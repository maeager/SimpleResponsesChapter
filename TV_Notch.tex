\section[TV Cell Model]{Tuberculo-ventral cell model: Asymmetric broadband inhibition }
\label{sec:tv-cell-model}
% - A ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Background}

Tuberculoventral (TV) cells are glycinergic, inhibitory cells found in
the deep layers of the DCN that send axon collaterals to the
VCN\@. They are characterized as having a non-monotonic response to
tones with increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband
noise \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}.
Anterograde labeling in the DCN suggests TV cells project
tonotopically to the AVCN not just on-CF, but also to the low and high
frequency side bands in the AVCN
\citep{MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.
Ultra-structural labeling of synapses in the rat DCN suggest TV cells
are inhibited by glycinergic DS cells and from sources in the DCN but
excitatory inputs were not found from TS cells in the rat
\citep{Rubio:2005}. Evidence in the mouse suggests otherwise since
intracellular responses from labeled TV cells in the mouse show clear
excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse inhibitory input from DS
cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1993}.

\medskip{} 

TV or vertical cells receive monosynaptic excitatory input from auditory
nerve ﬁbers \citep{OertelWu:1989}\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}. Taken
together, these two results suggest that low SR auditory nerve ﬁbers
may form the major excitatory input to type II cells. If true, this
hypothesis also could explain the ﬁnding that type II units have
consistently higher thresholds than DCN principal cells \citep{YoungBrownell:1976} because low SR auditory nerve ﬁbers also have
elevated thresholds relative to the lowest threshold auditory nerve
ﬁbers \citep{Liberman:1978}. However, patterns of auditory nerve
innervation of the DCN are most consistent with high SR ﬁber
innervation of vertical cell somata and low SR ﬁber innervation of
dendrites \citep{Liberman:1993}. In that case, the low spontaneous rates
and high sound thresholds of type II units might be caused by a high
intrinsic electrical threshold \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}; this is
consistent with the responses of vertical cells to intracellular
current injection \citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.


Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the VCN \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but the role of type II terminals in the VCN is
less clear. Three different hypotheses have been raised. The ﬁrst is
that this projection modulates the response thresholds of VCN
neurons \citep{PaoliniClark:1998}. 
The role of type II units in spectral processing is that of a
narrowband inhibitor. Responses of DCN principal cells are strongly
inhibited by this narrowband source. As a result, DCN principal cells
are inhibited by sharp spectral peaks close to their BF \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.


%\subsubsection{Synaptic organization: unresolved issues}

% Despite the coherent picture developed in the preceding text, there
% are some remaining uncertainties about type II synaptic
% organization. First, there are few inhibitory puncta on the somata
% of vertical cells, in comparison with DCN principal cells, \citep{Osen:1990,SaintBensonEtAl:1991,}, and little sign of disynaptic IPSPs
% in vertical cells after auditory-nerve stimulation in slice
% preparations \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}. Thus current anatomic and in
% vitro studies do not provide a basis for the strong inhibition seen
% physiologically. Second, the radiate (D-stellate) neurons are
% glycinergic \citep{DoucetRossEtAl:1999}, but the noise-driven inhibition of
% type II units is reduced signiﬁcantly by bicuculline as well as by
% strychnine (Fig. 8). The sensitivity of DCN cells to GABA
% antagonists has been reported before \citep{CasparyPazaraEtAl:1987,EvansZhou:1993}. It seems likely that there are GABAergic inhibitory
% inputs on type II units, in addition to the glycinergic inputs from
% radiate neurons. The source of these GABAergic inputs is not known,
% although there are many GABAergic cells in the cochlear nucleus
% \citep{KolstonOsenEtAl:1992}\citep{OsenOttersenEtAl:1990} as well as GABAergic
% projections from the superior olivary complex \citep{OstapoffMorestEtAl:1990,OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}
% .  Third, the evidence from two-tone response maps, inhibitory
% blockade, and noiseband widening suggests that the inhibition in
% type II units is centered on or near BF; models of type II responses
% assume the same thing. However, it is not clear that D-stellate
% cells project in a tonotopic fashion; indeed, injections of tracer
% into circumscribed regions of the tonotopic map of DCN ﬁll radiate
% cells across a wide range of the tonotopic map in VCN \citep{DoucetRyugo:1997}. Thus it is not clear how the apparent tonotopic
% projection of the wideband inhibitor would correspond to the
% apparently nontonotopic projection of radiate neurons. Because the
% details of the anatomic circuitry of the deep DCN are largely
% unknown, the relevance of these points cannot be properly evaluated
% at present. More information about the anatomic inputs to vertical
% cells, especially their dendritic inputs, is required.

%\subsubsection{Functional role of type II units}
% The role of type II units in spectral processing is that of a
% narrowband inhibitor. Responses of DCN principal cells are strongly
% inhibited by this narrowband source. As a result, DCN principal
% cells are inhibited by sharp spectral peaks close to their BF. These
% units also are inhibited by a wideband source, probably the onset-C
% neuron \citep{NelkenYoung:1994}, which produces the inhibition seen
% in principal cells in response to notches in the stimulus spectrum
% (Spirou and Young 1991; Young et al. 1992). Thus type II cells
% participate in the con-struction of the exquisite sensitivity of
% DCN principal cells to sharp spectral features, both peaks and
% notches.  Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the VCN
% \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but the role of type II terminals in
% the VCN is less clear. Three different hypotheses have been
% raised. The ﬁrst is that this projection modulates the response
% thresholds of VCN neurons \citep{PaoliniClark:1998}. This hypothesis
% is based on the ﬁnding that vertical cells provide a tono-topically
% organized inhibitory input to bushy and stellate neu-rons of the
% VCN (Wickesberg and Oertel 1990) and on the ﬁnding that injection of
% the GABA agonist muscimol into DCN produced a signiﬁcant lowering of
% the average threshold of VCN units \citep{PaoliniClark:1998}. The
% advantage of having VCN thresholds elevated in this way by DCN
% activity is not clear; moreover, the properties of the threshold
% elevation do not correspond to those of type II units, which are not
% spontane-ously active and have high-thresholds themselves. Thus the
% role of type II units in modulating VCN thresholds is not clear.
% The second hypothesis is that the inhibitory projection from DCN to
% VCN produces monaural echo suppression \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}. This hypothesis is based on the ﬁnding that vertical cells
% supply a delayed, frequency speciﬁc input to the VCN. Two-click data
% \citep{Wickesberg:1996} provide partial physiological support for this
% idea, but only 19% of VCN cells
% showed the expected increase in response to the second click after
% lidocaine injections in DCN. In general, the role of type II units
% in temporal processing is hard to interpret because their temporal
% properties are complex and nonlinear (Joris and Smith 1998).

% The third hypothesis on The role of the type II projection to VCN is
% that it helps to reduce the effects of spectral notches caused by
% the acoustical properties of the pinnae (Rice et al.  1992) on the
% representation of complex sounds in the VCN (Nelken and Young
% 1996). Unlike DCN neurons, VCN cells are not inhibited by narrow
% spectral peaks or notches. Presumably the inhibition from type II
% units is too weak in VCN to produce the effects that are seen in
% DCN. Instead the tonotopic array of type II neurons weakly inhibits
% VCN principal cells except in the region of the notch itself. The
% result is an enhancement of the spectral information in the notch
% relative to its surround, essentially counteracting the effects of
% pinna acoustics in producing the spectral notch. In this way, infor-
% mation about the notch itself would be conveyed in the outputs of
% the DCN and information about the spectral shape of the stimulus
% would be conveyed by the outputs of the VCN.  Type II neurons may
% participate in all the functions proposed in the preceding text, but
% more information about their con-nections and responses to complex
% stimuli are required to fully evaluate these
% hypotheses. Nevertheless, the accumulated physiological and anatomic
% evidence indicate that type II neurons play an important role in
% establishing the response properties of a wide variety of cochlear
% nucleus neurons, and thus they play a crucial role in the
% transformations of the auditory representation that take place in
% the cochlear nucleus.
