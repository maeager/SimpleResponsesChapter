\section[TV Cell Model]{Tuberculo-ventral cell model: Asymmetric broadband inhibition }
\label{sec:tv-cell-model}
% - A ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Background}

Tuberculoventral (TV) cells are glycinergic, inhibitory cells found in
the deep layers of the DCN that send axon collaterals to the VCN\@. They
are characterized as having a non-monotonic response to tones with
increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}.
Anterograde labeling in the DCN suggests TV cells project
tonotopically to the AVCN not just on-CF, but also to the low and high
frequency side bands in the AVCN
\citep{MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.
Ultra-structural labeling of synapses in the rat DCN suggest TV cells
are inhibited by glycinergic DS cells and from sources in the DCN but
excitatory inputs were not found from TS cells in the rat
\citep{Rubio:2005}. Evidence in the mouse suggests otherwise since
intracellular responses from labeled TV cells in the mouse show clear
excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse inhibitory input from DS
cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1993}.



\quote{ \emph{Spirou}

Vertical cells receive monosynaptic excitatory input from au-
ditory nerve ﬁbers (Oertel and Wu 1989; Zhang and Oertel
1993b). Taken together, these two results suggest that low SR
auditory nerve ﬁbers may form the major excitatory input to
type II cells. If true, this hypothesis also could explain the
ﬁnding that type II units have consistently higher thresholds
than DCN principal cells (Young and Brownell 1976) because
low SR auditory nerve ﬁbers also have elevated thresholds
relative to the lowest threshold auditory nerve ﬁbers (Liberman
1978). However, patterns of auditory nerve innervation of the
DCN are most consistent with high SR ﬁber innervation of
vertical cell somata and low SR ﬁber innervation of dendrites
(Liberman 1993). In that case, the low spontaneous rates and
high sound thresholds of type II units might be caused by a
high intrinsic electrical threshold (Hancock et al. 1997); this is
consistent with the responses of vertical cells to intracellular
current injection (Ding and Voigt 1997; Zhang and Oertel
1993b).


...
Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the VCN
(Wickesberg and Oertel 1990), but the role of type II terminals
in the VCN is less clear. Three different hypotheses have been
raised. The ﬁrst is that this projection modulates the response
thresholds of VCN neurons (Paolini et al. 1998). This hypoth-

principal cells are inhibited by sharp spectral peaks close to
their BF.

type II units. Thus if onset-C units are not the inhibitory input
to type II units, then the actual inhibitor should have properties
identical to the onset-C unit.

Synaptic organization: unresolved issues

Despite the coherent picture developed in the preceding text,
there are some remaining uncertainties about type II synaptic
organization. First, there are few inhibitory puncta on the
somata of vertical cells, in comparison with DCN principal
cells, (Osen 1990; Saint Marie et al. 1991) and little sign of
disynaptic IPSPs in vertical cells after auditory-nerve stimula-
tion in slice preparations (Zhang and Oertel 1993b). Thus
current anatomic and in vitro studies do not provide a basis for
the strong inhibition seen physiologically. Second, the radiate
(D-stellate) neurons are glycinergic (Doucet et al. 1999), but the
noise-driven inhibition of type II units is reduced signiﬁcantly
by bicuculline as well as by strychnine (Fig. 8). The sensitivity
of DCN cells to GABA antagonists has been reported before
(Caspary et al. 1987; Evans and Zhou 1993). It seems likely
that there are GABAergic inhibitory inputs on type II units, in
addition to the glycinergic inputs from radiate neurons. The
source of these GABAergic inputs is not known, although there
are many GABAergic cells in the cochlear nucleus (Kolston et
al. 1992; Osen et al. 1990) as well as GABAergic projections
from the superior olivary complex (Ostapoff et al. 1990, 1997).
Third, the evidence from two-tone response maps, inhibitory
blockade, and noiseband widening suggests that the inhibition
in type II units is centered on or near BF; models of type II
responses assume the same thing. However, it is not clear that
D-stellate cells project in a tonotopic fashion; indeed, injections
of tracer into circumscribed regions of the tonotopic map of
DCN ﬁll radiate cells across a wide range of the tonotopic map
in VCN (Doucet and Ryugo 1997). Thus it is not clear how the
apparent tonotopic projection of the wideband inhibitor would
correspond to the apparently nontonotopic projection of radiate
neurons. Because the details of the anatomic circuitry of the
deep DCN are largely unknown, the relevance of these points
cannot be properly evaluated at present. More information
about the anatomic inputs to vertical cells, especially their
dendritic inputs, is required.

Functional role of type II units
The role of type II units in spectral processing is that of a
narrowband inhibitor. Responses of DCN principal cells are
strongly inhibited by this narrowband source. As a result, DCN
principal cells are inhibited by sharp spectral peaks close to
their BF. These units also are inhibited by a wideband source,
probably the onset-C neuron (Nelken and Young 1994), which
produces the inhibition seen in principal cells in response to
notches in the stimulus spectrum (Spirou and Young 1991;
Young et al. 1992). Thus type II cells participate in the con-
struction of the exquisite sensitivity of DCN principal cells to
sharp spectral features, both peaks and notches.
Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the VCN
(Wickesberg and Oertel 1990), but the role of type II terminals
in the VCN is less clear. Three different hypotheses have been
raised. The ﬁrst is that this projection modulates the response
thresholds of VCN neurons (Paolini et al. 1998). This hypoth-
esis is based on the ﬁnding that vertical cells provide a tono-
topically organized inhibitory input to bushy and stellate neu-
rons of the VCN (Wickesberg and Oertel 1990) and on the
ﬁnding that injection of the GABA agonist muscimol into DCN
produced a signiﬁcant lowering of the average threshold of
VCN units (Paolini et al. 1998). The advantage of having VCN
thresholds elevated in this way by DCN activity is not clear;
moreover, the properties of the threshold elevation do not
correspond to those of type II units, which are not spontane-
ously active and have high-thresholds themselves. Thus the
role of type II units in modulating VCN thresholds is not clear.
The second hypothesis is that the inhibitory projection from
DCN to VCN produces monaural echo suppression (Wickes-
berg and Oertel 1990). This hypothesis is based on the ﬁnding
that vertical cells supply a delayed, frequency speciﬁc input to
the VCN. Two-click data (Wickesberg 1996) provide partial
physiological support for this idea, but only 19% of VCN cells
showed the expected increase in response to the second click
after lidocaine injections in DCN. In general, the role of type
II units in temporal processing is hard to interpret because their
temporal properties are complex and nonlinear (Joris and
Smith 1998).

The third hypothesis on the role of the type II projection to
VCN is that it helps to reduce the effects of spectral notches
caused by the acoustical properties of the pinnae (Rice et al.
1992) on the representation of complex sounds in the VCN
(Nelken and Young 1996). Unlike DCN neurons, VCN cells
are not inhibited by narrow spectral peaks or notches. Presum-
ably the inhibition from type II units is too weak in VCN to
produce the effects that are seen in DCN. Instead the tonotopic
array of type II neurons weakly inhibits VCN principal cells
except in the region of the notch itself. The result is an
enhancement of the spectral information in the notch relative to
its surround, essentially counteracting the effects of pinna
acoustics in producing the spectral notch. In this way, infor-
mation about the notch itself would be conveyed in the outputs
of the DCN and information about the spectral shape of the
stimulus would be conveyed by the outputs of the VCN.
Type II neurons may participate in all the functions proposed
in the preceding text, but more information about their con-
nections and responses to complex stimuli are required to fully
evaluate these hypotheses. Nevertheless, the accumulated
physiological and anatomic evidence indicate that type II neu-
rons play an important role in establishing the response prop-
erties of a wide variety of cochlear nucleus neurons, and thus
they play a crucial role in the transformations of the auditory
representation that take place in the cochlear nucleus.
