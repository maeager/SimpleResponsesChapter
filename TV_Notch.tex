Table~\ref{tab:TVNotchModelSummary} 

The experimental data by \citet{ReissYoung:2005} was recorded from adult cats, with the notch noise produced in the frequency domain (accounting for calibration of the ear canal speaker spectrum) and sampled with fixed random phases in the time domain.
The notch sweep sets used by \citeauthor{ReissYoung:2005} were generated with logarithmically constant notch widths and notch center frequencies ranging from 1 octave below to 1 octave above \BF~in $1/50$ octave steps.
The notch noise presented in this optimisation routine was generated in Octave using frozen Gaussian noise (100kHz sampling rate) and a Chebyshev type II band reject filter.
The sound level in the \citet{ReissYoung:2005} data further complicates the situation.
The power spectrum is maintained at a constant level per frequency band (dB per Hz$^{1/2}$) and this is processed and scaled at each point in the notch sweep.
For a single presentation used in this experiment the sound level plays an important part in stimulating the \ANFs~and contributing interneurons.
The experimental data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TVReissFig9}, show the mean response to notch sweeps at 22 dB/Hz$^{1/2}$.

The experimental data, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TVReissFig9}, is the average responses of type II DCN units to notch sweeps.
The optimisation routine would be prohibitive if it was a notch sweep simulated on a single neuron; therefore, this optimisation uses a single notch presentation across an entire network of TV cells.
Accordingly, the fitness function must take into account the relative position of cells in the network when comparing the experimental data.
For example, when presented with a notch noise filtered between 5kHz and 10kHz, a unit with \CF~of 5kHz will see a falling edge of a 1 octave notch, whereas a unit with \CF~of 10kHz, will see a rising edge of a half octave notch.
Figure~\ref{fig:TVNotchDiagram} shows the combination of the type DCN II unit notch data for 1 octave.

Higher thresholds in type~II \DCN~units \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} and the presence of multiple inhibitory synapses \citep{Alibardi:2006} suggest \TV~cells either receive a strong inhibitory influence or they have a lower \RMP~due to a lower leak current reversal potential. A reduced resting membrane potential may increase the threshold for excitatory inputs to generate action potentials.

% \yellownote{I allowed HSR2TV weight value go negative to give a constant  inhibitory input. Then on 2 other runs I shifted the reversal potential of the leak current to $-70$ and $-75$.}

The big issue with the optimisation of population mean rate responses is that the model could be over simplified and remove timing information.
The \HSR~rate response is generally flat at medium to high sound intensities.
\DS~cell response has a regular onset spike but has a low rate throughout the stimulus, which detracts from the purpose of using a whole network to optimise parameters for synaptic inputs regarding \TV~cells.
The \TV~rate response could therefore just be modeled on the \LSR~response using a simple gradient-decent method.
