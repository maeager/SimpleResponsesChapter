\small
  To understand brain function, the focus of investigations
  must expand from detailed responses and structure of single cells to
  include unit responses to the activity of other cells, and how these
  responses are distributed over a population of similar cells as
  wells as across populations of different cells. \\

\yellownote{TODO: Get page number of this quote}

Shamma calls upon the neuroscience community to investigate the
role of populations of neurons in neurophysiology.  To do so, this
chapter draws on the wealth of experimental data accumulated in auditory
neuroscience to create a detailed \BNN model of the T stellate
microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus (hereafter referred to as the \CNSM
model, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}).  The design
and methods for the construction of the model provide insights
relevant to other neural network models of the brain, especially those
that use sensory pathways.

Despite advances in computational neuroscience, it remains a challenging
task to develop an accurate representation of the complex behaviour of
real neural networks.  Choices, guesses and assumptions continue to be
integral parts of neuronal modelling \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}.  With
the acceleration of computational power and enhanced experimental
techniques in multi-unit recordings, it is possible to develop more
detailed neural models. There is much to be gained from
biophysically-realistic modelling approaches, especially in the
thoroughly investigated cochlear nucleus of mammals, bats and birds.

\yellownote{TODO: think about linking to end of methods chapter.  I.e. reproducbable research}

# \yellownote{TODO: See neural detail in auditory
# system\citep{LuRubioEtAl:2008}} \yellownote{Discuss use of Poisson
# models vs HH-like models.  Discuss single cell simulation vs whole
# network simulation during optimisation.}

To develop and optimise detailed neural models and neural network
models, reproducible research methods are required.  
In this chapter, the table method introduced by
\citet[as~described~in~Chapter~2]{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is used to summarise the neural
models used in each optimisation step.  

# The Nordlie tables shown in
# each optimisation stage consist of A) the model summary, B) cell type
# populations, C) connectivity between two cell types, D) neuron and
# synapse models, and E) optimisation parameters.
# This method aims to
# show a consistent and recognisable format for presenting various
# neural network models and their constituents.
# \yellownote{this needs more explanation in the methods sections}


To create a realistic microcircuit, the parameter optimisation routine
needs to be developed in sequential stages.  In this chapter, the
connections within the \CNSM model (Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}) were
developed using such a sequential method of optimisation steps.
Parameters in the microcircuit can be separated into two classes,
cell-based and connectivity-based.  The cell-based parameters for each
cell model in the \CNSM model, discussed in Section \ref{sec:Meth:cell-models}
[[*Neural%20Cell%20Models][Neural Cell Models]], remain relatively fixed. The connectivity-based
parameters, introduced in Section \ref{sec:Ch2:Parameters} [[*Connectivity%20Parameters][Connectivity
Parameters]], are the main focus for this chapter.  The parameters in the
sequential optimisation stages were chosen so that they did not
influence the properties of previously fitted parameters.  The
parameters of each cell type were determined based on experimental data
or were optimised based solely on responses to simple stimuli. Each cell
type was typified with its characteristic \PSTH in response to short
tone bursts
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}, and the
\EIRA to tones across the frequency spectrum \citep{Evans:1992}.  The
process methods for optimisation were described in Section
\ref{sec:Ch2:Optimisation}, [[*Optimisation%20Techniques][Optimisation Techniques]].

# These included specifying the model to be optimised,
# the criteria, and the parameters and the constraints of
# the model, and implementing the optimisation.
# The restricted network models optimised in each section are presented in their
# Background sub-section.   
# Criteria to be satisfied are presented in Implementation
# sections by specifying the experimental data set, the stimulus and the
# recorded output analysis required.  Parameters and constraints of the
# model are also presented in the Implementation section and the
# accompanying Nordlie table.  Optimisation results are presented in the
# Results section of each step.


** Cochlear Nucleus Stellate Microcircuit Model 

The \CNSM model in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit} shows the following cell models:
1. The \AN model: A phenomenological auditory model provides spiking
   input to \CN neurons across frequencies and spontaneous rate types of
   the \ANFs from an arbitrary input stimulus
   \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  The base line in Figure
   \ref{fig:microcircuit} is a simplification of \ANFs from low \CF to
   high \CF (left to right). The model reproduces responses for high and
   low \SR \ANFs at 100 channels across the frequency range 200 Hz to 48
   kHz.
2. The Golgi cell: a \GABA-ergic \VCN marginal shell unit that is
   presumed to regulate excitability in the \GCD and core \VCN units
   \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Only one /in vivo/ study has
   recorded extracellular data in the marginal shell area of the \CN
   \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The presumed characteristics of Golgi cells
   are taken from that study and are defined by a monotonic response to
   tones and noise, a Type I\slash III \EIRA, and an unusual or chopper
   \PSTH.
3. The D stellate cell: a large, glycinergic, multipolar\slash stellate cell with \OnC\ 
   \PSTH response that acts as a coincidence detector.  Its large
   dendritic area increases its response to noise, allowing it to behave
   as a wide-band inhibitor in the \VCN, \DCN, and contralateral \CN
   \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
4. The Tuberculoventral cell: a glycinergic, Type II \EIRA unit in the
   deep layer of the \DCN \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  This cell acts
   as a delayed echo-suppressor and narrow-band inhibitor, with
   recurrent connections between D and T stellate cells in the \VCN
   \citep{Alibardi:2006,OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991}.
5. The T stellate cell: one of the major output projection cells of the
   \CN to the inferior colliculus.  This multipolar neuron
   has been shown to have robust spectral representation and enhanced
   synchronisation to modulation in speech sounds
   \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

Optimisation of a detailed \BNN model requires a realistic input model
with which to mimic the behaviour experimentally observed in live
neural networks. 
In examining the properties of a detailed neural model of the cochlear
nucleus, a realistic and phenomenologically sound auditory model is
needed to represent sounds and transformations that occur in the
central auditory system.
The input to the \CNSM model, the auditory nerve
fibres, is discussed in the next section. To further fit the parameters
of the CN model, a simplistic and sequential method is applied to each
of the cell types using experimental data.

# \yellownote{TODO: This para is about pushing the reader towards the following

# Cochlear Nucleus Stellate Microcircuit 

** Auditory Nerve Fibre Model 


The \ANF inputs to the \CNSM model neurons were drawn from 
the Carney model, a phenomenological auditory periphery model first presented  in \citet{Carney:1993}.
This chapter uses more recent derivations of the Carney model:
#Three \ANF  #the ARLO model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001}, the
the Bruce model \citep{BruceSachsEtAl:2003,ZilanyBruce:2006,ZilanyBruce:2007} and the Zilany model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.
# The auditory model consists of an outer\slash middle ear pre-processing
# filter, a cochlea filterbank, IHC-to-AN synapse model and dead-time
# modified Poisson spike generator, as shown in Figure
# \ref{fig:ZilanyBruceFig}.  \citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated
# cochlea filters based on the critical bandwidths obtained from
# psychophysical experiments in humans.  The ARLO model of the cat
# auditory periphery, with non-linear compression and two-tone
# suppression, is used in this study except in the vowel simulation where
# the human auditory periphery model is used.

# \yellownote{TODO: 
# AN model paragraph has been changed - fix any comment related to new
# Zilany}

# The \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007} model improves the previous AN model by
# an additional signal path and its predictions have matched a wide
# range of physiological data in normal and impaired cat data. The
# most recent AN model comprises an power-law synapse model, with
# internal $1/f$ noise, that enhances the behaviour of long-term
# dependence in ANFs \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.

# \yellownote{TODO Why is it the cat model? updating Carney model? Updating
#   of the Carney auditory model has led to the change in the model's
#   configuration from an original implementation of the rat model.  The
#   default species is the cat and will be used in the data presented in
#   this chapter.}


# ** Spiking in Poisson Neural Models 

The neural models used in the \ANFs and Golgi cell model were
inhomogeneous Poisson processes.  The instantaneous rate produced the
input \AN model (chosen from the Bruce or Zilany model) or through the
Golgi filter model (Section \ref{sec:GolgiModelOpt}) was passed through the
Jackson spiking model \citep{Jackson:2003,JacksonCarney:2005}, which
includes refractory effects typical of the \ANFs.  Spike trains for each
neuron in the \AN model were created at the start of each repetition of
the stimulus.  Further detail on \HSR and \LSR ANF models are in Section
\ref{sec:Ch2:HSRLSR}.



 \yellownote{TODO:  talk about HSR and LSR in the \CNSM model}

# Analysis of the frequency
# response area of ANF generates known parameters for each fibre, these are:
# \begin{itemize}
# \item the spontaneous rate (SR), generated in silence and is
#   categoried into two groups High SR (\gt 18 sp/s) and Low SR (\lt 18
#   sp/s);
# \item threshold, the sound pressure level(SPL) at which the cell
#   responds above the spontaneous rate
# \item characteristic frequency (CF)
# \end{itemize}

** Neural Models

Single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-like neural models were used for the
\DS, \TV and \TS cells in the \CNSM model.  The membrane current models
used in each of the cell types were those developed by
\citet{RothmanManis:2003b}.

\yellownote{TODO expand on specifics for this chapter}

# Type I-c classic regular firing contains a voltage-activated
# sodium, high threshold potassium, and hyperpolarisation mixed-cation,
# and leak current channels.  This neural model an integrator and is
# strongly influenced by the \Ih current, which is active at rest.  Type
# I-t transient regular firing type is similar to the Type 1 classic but
# with A-type potassium current channels.  A-type potassium channels are
# unique to the cochlear nucleus, particularly to T stellate cells
# \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}.  \DS cells contain
# low-threshold potassium current channels, which is strongest in bushy
# cells, to enhance response to coincident inputs.

# \yellownote{TODO: Discuss RM model (put in Methods Chapter).  Perhaps expand
#   more on the role of the currents on each neuron in the CN model.}

** Connectivity and Network Parameters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :LABEL: sec:Ch3:ConnectivityNetworkParameters
   :END:

Tonotopic connectivity in the \CNSM model was
defined by the regular organisation of afferent \ANFs into distinct
iso-frequency channels.  The channels are separated using even spatial
distance (based on the basilar membrane and auditory nerve separation)
with centre frequency calculated by the Greenwood function for the cat
\citep[see~Chapter~\ref{sec:Methods},][]{Greenwood:1990}.  The \HSR \ANF
terminals of individual fibres generally cover 70 \um and 
\LSR fibres cover
100 \um in mice \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988,OertelWu:1989}. 
\yellownote{TODO: put greenwood function in Methods}

Figure \ref{fig:CNconn} shows the Gaussian distribution of
connections between cell types in the \CN.  The \CFs of the \CN channels
were separated using the same Greenwood function used for the
filterbank of \AN frequency channels.

** Synapse Models

\glsunset{AMPA}\glsunset{GlyR}

The synaptic models for \AMPA, \GlyR and \GABAa receptors were described in Chapter \ref{sec:Chapter2} Section \ref{sec:Ch2:Synapse}.


** Synaptic Jitter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :LABEL: sec:Ch3:Jitter
   :END:

To account for \ANF synapses placed at various distances along the
dendrites of \TS, \DS and \TV cells a random jitter was introduced to
the synaptic delay.  Jitter was calculated around a minimum delay
(e.g. \dANFTS) as an absolute Gaussian distribution with zero mean and
standard deviation of 0.1 ms. Figure \ref{fig:CSjitter} shows the
effects of jitter on the intracellular responses of a Type I-t Rothman
and Manis neural model \cite{RothmanManis:2003b} averaged over 25
repetitions.  The effects of adding jitter to individual ANF inputs the
CN neurons are to increase the mean and standard deviation of
\FSL. These effects replicate dendritic delays without the added
computational cost of a passive neural compartment in the model.
Dendritic attenuation of the \EPSP is not accounted for.

** Synaptic Delays
   :PROPERTIES:
   :LABEL: sec:Ch3:Delays
   :END:

The effective delay of the \AN model does not take into account the
conduction and synaptic transmission delay in reaching post-synaptic
neurons in the \CN. Accordingly, an additional delay component was
required in each of the synaptic connections in the \CNSM model
involving \ANFs.  Mean \FSL to short \CF tones and click
stimuli were used to set delay times between \ANFs and \CN cells
\citep{RhodeSmith:1986,RhodeOertelEtAl:1983,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The additional delay was defined using the \FSL of high
frequency units as the sum of the \ANFs' \FSL, \ANF
conduction delay, and the synaptic transmission delay.  The first spike
latency measured in high \CF units in the ARLO \AN model
\citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} for \HSR fibers was 1.5 ms.

\yellownote{DAVID:  Do you think the next paragraph and table belongs in a results section?}

Table \ref{tab:Meth:AddDelay} shows the additional delay component for
each cell type, calculated from population statistics, to ensure the first
spike latency in the models matched the experimental data.  The models
were designated from the basic \RM  neural
models \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The relative difference between the \DS cell model's mean \FSL and
the other Type I cell types can be attributed to the additional \IKLT
channels in the Type I-II \RM neural model.  \IKLT is
active at \RMP and decreases the overall input resistance and membrane
time constant, reducing the time to fire an action potential.  \TS cells are
designated with the Type I-t \RM model, which contains an
additional \IKA channel current over the Type I-c model, but were not
significantly different from the classic Type I models in \TV and \GLG
cell models.

** Simulation Specifications
#and Parallel Capabilities

All simulations were performed in the neural simulation package
[[latex:progname][NEURON]]. for further specifications see Section \ref{sec:Ch2:SimSpecs}
[[*Simulation%20and%20Implementation%20of%20the%20CNSM%20Model][Simulation and Implementation of the CNSM Model]].  The time step of the
numerical integration performed in each of the simulations in the
chapter was 0.05 ms.  Input spikes for Poisson neural models (\HSR, \LSR
and \GLG cell models) were calculated at the start of repetitions.

# The parallel is based on the  [[latex:progname][NEURON]] network model [[latex:progname][netmod]] \citet{MiglioreCanniaEtAl:2006} (see
# SenseLab's ModelDB models [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=52034][52034]], [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=2730][2730]], and [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=51781][51781]]).

** Optimisation Routine

\yellownote{ TODO  }

The optimisation routine used in this chapter was NEURON's [[latex:progname][fit\_praxis]]
function, which uses the principle axis algorithm 
\citep[PRAXIS,~][]{Brent:1976}. The PRAXIS method returns the minimum of the error function,
=fun=, of n variables using the principal axis method without the
use of =fun='s gradient.

** Verification of Cell Model Responses to Simple Tones and Noise

To verify the optimisation processes, a suite of
tests were run across the whole \CNSM model. 

\yellownote{The purpose of these simulations were done to ensure the optimised parameters could be used across all frequency channels.}

This section aims to show the
behaviour of the entire CN stellate microcircuit using parameters
obtained from the optimisation processes.

The stimuli presented to the stellate microcircuit included:
1. Rate-level response to pure tones at the characteristic frequency
   of the centre channel of the network, 5.81 kHz. The sound level was
   varied from 0 to 90 dB SPL.
2. Rate-level response to white noise at levels 0 to 100 dB SPL.

** Background

# GLG Cell Model
*** Morphology of Golgi Cells

Golgi cells can be distinguished from the numerous smaller granule cells
by their larger cell body and surrounding plexus of dendritic and axonal
neurites. The soma diameter of Golgi cells is approximately 15 \um
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, while the diameter of granule cells
is 8 \um in cats \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980} and 6 \um in rats and
mice \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,Alibardi:2003}.  Smooth, tapering
dendrites, between 50 and 100 \um long, emanate in all directions
(mice: \citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, see also
\citealt{Cant:1993,MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}).  A dense, axonal plexus,
limited to the plane of the granule cell domain, extends approximately 250 \um
from the soma in all directions
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,BensonBrown:2004}.

# In layer 2 of the DCN Alibardi rat (9–15 \um) GABA-ergic cells round cell body
# surrounded by small granule cells immuno-negative to Glycine and GABA.

The dendrites of \VCN Golgi cells are mitochondria-rich and make
glomeruli complexes with long synaptic junctions with the mossy fibre
boutons \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}. The somata generally have few
boutons of flat or pleomorphic vesicle type, characteristic of
glycinergic and GABAergic terminals. Along with inhibitory boutons,
the dendrites also receive excitatory input with large (Type I \ANF)
and small (Type II \ANF and granule cell) vesicles
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Ryugo:2008}.

#  \citep{Alibardi:2003} In non-tonotopic circuits integration between acoustic
# and non-acoustic inputs occurs \citep{RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993}.

# The contribution of the circuits of granule cell areas of the cochlear nuclear
# complex to the processing of the acoustic signal is poorly understood (Kane,
# 1974, 1977; Mugnaini et al. 1980; 1984, 1997; Hutson and Morest, 1996; Wedman
# et al. 1996; Morest, 1997; Hurd et al. 1999).  For a review of non-auditory
# inputs to GCD see \citealt{OhlroggeDoucetEtAl:2001}.

# # from Mugnaini This paper describes the fine structure of granule cells and
# granule-associated interneurons (termed Golgi cells) in the cochlear nuclei of
# cat, rat and mouse.  Granule cells and Golgi cells are present in defined
# regions of ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei collectively termed "cochlear
# granule cell domain'. The granule cells are small neurons with two or three
# short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with terminal
# expansions. These participate in glomerular synaptic arrays similar to those
# of the cerebellar cortex. In the glomeruli the dendrites form short Type 1
# synapses with a large, centrally-located mossy bouton containing round
# synaptic vesicles and Type 2 synapses with peripherally located, smaller
# boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles. The granule cell axons is thin and
# beaded and, on its way to the molecular layer of the \DCN, takes a straight
# course, which in ventral nucleus is parallel to the pial surface. Neurons of
# the second category resemble cerebellar Golgi cells and occur everywhere
# interspersed among the granule cells. They are usually larger than the granule
# cells and give rise to dendrites which may branch close to and curve around
# the cell body. The dendrites contain numerous mitochondria and are laden with
# thin appendages, giving them a hairy appearance.  Both the cell body and the
# stem dendrites participate in glomerular synaptic arrays.  Golgi cell
# glomeruli are distinguishable from the granule cell glomeruli by unique
# features of the dendritic profiles and by longer, Type 1 synaptic junctions
# with the central mossy bouton.  The Golgi cell axon forms a beaded plexus
# close to the parent cell body. The synaptic vesicle population of the mossy
# boutons suggests that they are a heterogeneous group and may have multiple
# origins.  Apparently, each of the various classes participates in both granule
# and Golgi cell glomeruli.  The smaller peripheral boutons with pleomorphic
# vesicles in the two types of glomeruli may represent Golgi cell axons which
# make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell axons
# which make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell
# dendrites, on the other hand, are also contacted by small boutons en passant
# with round synaptic vesicles, which may represent granule cell axons. A
# tentative scheme of the circuitry in the cochlear granule cell domain is
# presented. The similarity with the cerebellar granule cell layer is striking.

*** Cellular Mechanisms of Golgi Cells

In a single study in mice, intracellular recordings of Golgi cells 
showed a classic repetitively-firing response to current clamp and an
inward rectifying response to voltage clamp
\citep[][Figure~\ref{fig:GolgiIV}]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Golgi
cells are classified as a Type I current-clamp neuron and act as simple integrators of
synaptic input \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
# Their intrinsic properties suggests Golgi cells are simple integrators.
Response to AN shocks in Golgi cells were found to be delayed by approximately 0.7
ms relative to the core \VCN units, with minimum delay in most cells
around 1.3 ms \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

*** Acoustic Response of Golgi cells

# The physiological response of Golgi cells has not been extensively studied.

Extracellular recordings from labelled Golgi cells are not available
in the literature; however, an electrophysiological study of the \GCD
(or marginal shell of the \VCN in cats) has been done by one group
\citep{Ghoshal:1997,GhoshalKim:1997,GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a}
without direct labelling of recorded units.  Any extracellular spikes
recorded in the \GCD are most likely from Golgi cells since granule
cell somata are less than 10 \um and their narrow axons are unlikely
to elicit electrical activity in the electrodes
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

## Change this sentence
# There was a substantial presence of

Strongly driven units in the anterior \VCN shell exhibit non-saturating
rate-level functions to pure tone, noise or both with dynamic ranges
as wide as 89 dB \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The majority of
\GCD units recorded by \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} were classified as Type
I\slash III or III \EIRA units, showing a monotonic increase in firing
rate with increasing sound intensity to tones and noise.  Some units
examined showed Type II or Type IV \EIRA properties. One unit was
classified as Type II due to its poor response to noise but it did not
show a reduction of response to tones at high \SPL (typical of \DCN
Type II units) \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. Two units with low \CF (< 1.5
kHz) were classified as Type II \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The \PSTH of
the units included wide chopper, \OnC, and pause-build; however, nearly
one third of units did not fit into the known classifications and were
called unusual \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.

The latency of acoustically driven \GCD recorded units ranges from 2.4
ms to over 10 ms, with a mean of 3.75 ms.  The acoustic latency closely
matches the minimum latency of \EPSPs to AN shocks recorded in mice
/in vitro/ preparations \citep[1.3~ms,][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
Longer latencies (\gt10 ms) may be due to Type II \ANFs (estimated
theoretical latency of 10 ms \citep{Brown:1993}) or from
polysynaptic excitation by granule cells.

The assumed functional role of Golgi cells is to
regulate granule cells but they may also provide automatic gain
control to the principal \VCN units, primarily D and T stellate cells
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

** Implementation

\yellownote{first sentence too long and could go at start of golgi section}
The presence of GABAergic inputs to \VCN and \DCN neurons has been
verified by labeled terminals adjacent to the soma and dendrites
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,BabalianRyugoEtAl:2003}
and release from inhibition in their response areas with
ionotopopheretic application of the \GABAa antagonist, bicuculine
\citep{EvansZhao:1998,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The source of GABAergic inputs to cells in the mammalian \CN is
somewhat contentious.  Studies show that GABAergic inputs to the \CN
generally arise in the peri-olivary regions of the medulla in cats
\citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997} and birds
\citep{LachicaRubsamenEtAl:1995,YangMonsivaisEtAl:1999}.  Slice
preparations of the isolated murine \VCN show strong and immediate
sensitivity to bicuculine in T and D stellate cells from a source
within the \CN complex \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The only
known source of \GABA intrinsic to the \VCN is the Golgi cells of the
\GCD overlying the \VCN
\citep{Mugnaini:1985,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

Inputs to Golgi cells are more complicated than the inputs to core
\VCN neurons.  Golgi cells are sparse in the \GCD, surrounded by the
many smaller excitatory granule cells that form small en-passant
endings.  Type II \ANFs create diffuse glutamatergic release sites in
the \GCD \citep{HurdHutsonEtAl:1999,BensonBrown:2004} that may
stimulate NMDA glutamate receptors in Golgi cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

In the creation of the Golgi cell model, we reduced the explicit
behaviour of Golgi cells down to four major details:
 1. Golgi cells are classic repetitively-firing neurons due to their
    Type I current clamp response \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
 2. The minimum \EPSP in Golgi cells to an electric shock of the AN
    \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} and mean first spike latency to
    acoustic stimuli \citep{GhoshalKim:1997} are significantly different
    from the core \VCN units.
 3. Golgi cells have a low maximum rate and large dynamic range to
    tone and noise increases, given that marginal shell extracellular
    recordings of \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} could not come from granule
    cells.
 4. The low threshold in Golgi cells can\-not be solely due to \LSR
    \ANFs \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. The lack of extensive experimental
    data regarding Type II \ANF units that project to the \GCD and
    granule cell response to acoustic input, meant that an inhomogeneous
    Poisson rate neural model was preferred over the Hodgkin-Huxley type
    neural model in the Golgi cell used in the \CNSM model.  Although
    \HSR \ANF terminals do not generally project into the \GCD, they are
    included in this model to provide some low level sound-induced
    activity.

The Golgi cell model is implemented as an instantaneous-rate Poisson
rate model, shown in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}D and in
Figure \ref{fig:GolgiDiagram}.  The primary inputs are from the auditory
model's instantaneous rate outputs with connections across frequency
channels.  The strength of \HSR and \LSR \ANF inputs to Golgi cells was determined by
a Gaussian distribution in units of channel separation in the network.
The weighted sum of \HSR and \LSR instantaneous-rate vectors were
smoothed out by an alpha function mimicking a synaptic and dendritic
smoothing filter.  
# The synaptic and dendritic filter kernel, $\alpha(t)$ was
# normalised by setting the area under the function to 1. For a large
# enough filter length, the alpha function integral ($\int \alpha(t) dt =
# (-\Gtau^2 - t \cdot \Gtau)\cdot \exp(-\frac{t}{\Gtau})$) approximately equals
# $\Gtau^2$. In this case $10 \times \Gtau$ is used for the filter length.

Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}A shows the model summary used to
optimise the Golgi cell model.  As explained in the Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}, Section \ref{sec:Ch2:Optimisation}, the
Nordlie tables are used to communicate detailed neural models and
networks for further replication by the computational neuroscience
community.  The topology of the ventral cochlear nucleus follows the
same tonotopic organisation of the auditory nerve, with 100 evenly
spaced frequency channels.  As Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}B
shows, the ANFs were not required because only the instantaneous
profiles of each \AN frequency channel were used in the Golgi model.
The connectivity between \ANFs and Golgi cells (Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}C) is a simple place-based Gaussian
spread, as explained in the Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter} (Section
\ref{sec:Ch2:ConnectivityandTopology}
# [[*Connectivity%20and%20Topology][Connectivity and Topology in Neural Microcircuits]]).

The weight vectors, $\mathbf{w}_{HSR}$ and $\mathbf{w}_{LSR}$, span

Instantaneous-rate profiles of the \AN have size $N_\textrm{channel}$
and length determined by the stimulus ($N_\textrm{stim}$ = stimulus
duration / sampling rate).  The intermediate step in the Golgi cell
model, $r(\cdot)$, corrects the output rate for the desired
spontaneous activity, \Gspon, and performs rectification on the signal
to avoid negative rate values.  The final step involves convolution
with the alpha function, $\alpha(t)$, as the synapto-dendritic
filtering mechanism in the Golgi cell.  The alpha filter length was 10
times the time constant, \Gtau, and its area under the function was
normalised to 1.  A more detailed explanation of the NEURON
implementation of the Golgi cell model is provided in the Appendix \ref{sec:Ch3:Appendix}.

** Optimisation Results

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult} shows the output of the test
optimisation trials for the Golgi cell model.  The testing trial used
only five sound levels (0, 15, 55, 75 and 85 dB \SPL) and detected the
mean rate from the instantaneous profile in its fitting routine.  The
best response obtained a minimum root mean squared error of 11.63
spikes/sec against the five points in the target experimental data of
unit S03-07  \citep[CF~21~kHz][]{GhoshalKim:1996}.  A rate-level
curve (green circles, Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult}) was generated
from the spiking output to show the discrepancy in the
spike-based rate-level and the monotonic rate based rate-level.  The
lack of low level response and a higher threshold indicated the need
for some \HSR input into the Golgi cell model.

The final optimisation routine with 22 levels and a Golgi cell model

the \citeauthor{GhoshalKim:1996} data.  Figure \ref{fig:GolgiResult}

combination of parameters as shown in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}E.  The fitness function error value of the 
#root mean squared error of the

[[../SimpleResponsesChapter/gfx/GolgiRateLevel_result.pdf]]

The parameters in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellResults} were within the
range of expected values.  \LSR inputs to the Golgi cell model
outweighed \HSR inputs by a factor greater than 10.  The monotonic
response of \LSR fibres at high sound levels was necessary to create
the large dynamic range in the Golgi cell model. Equally, the \HSR fibres were
necessary to provide some low level spontaneous rate activity.  The spontaneous
rate parameter matches the base response of unit S03-07 in Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiResult}.  The smoothing filter time constant of 5 ms is
a typical value in membrane time constants for neural models and fits
with the input resistance in intracellular recordings of Golgi cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

The input spread parameter was not well constrained by the optimisation
fitness routine with a pure tone input and a single neuron, but the
result was satisfactory given the uncertainty in \LSR fibres' axonal
organisation in the \GCD\@.  The dendritic widths in Golgi cells are
around 100 microns and the frequency separation laminae in the \VCN
core is approximately 70 \um, giving an expected result of 1.5
connectivity spread. Consequently, the result of 2.48 channels gives added
frequency spread from \LSR fibres.

** Verification of the Golgi Cell Model

After setting the optimised parameters in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellResults}, the Golgi cell model was run with tone and noise
inputs to determine its behaviour outside of the optimisation
routine.  The Golgi cell model was tested across the entire \CNSM model network
using tones, noise, and tones plus noise stimuli. Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiVerification}A, B and D shows the response of a Golgi
cell model at the centre of the network (CF=5.8 kHz) and had monotonic
responses to tones and noise similar to other Ghoshal and Kim units
(Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}).  Figure \ref{fig:GolgiVerification}C
shows the response of all Golgi units in the network to a 5.8 kHz tone,
increased from 0 to 90 dB \SPL.

* D Stellate Cell Model: Optimisation Using Click Recovery and Rate Level Responses 

** Background

\glsreset{DS} 

In the mammalian \CN, \DS cells have a wide ranging influence on almost all
primary cells of the \CN.  Glycinergic terminals of the \DS cell
contact \TS and bushy neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983},
and fusiform and \TV neurons in the ipsilateral \DCN
(Type II and Type IV \EIRA units). Some \DS cells exit the \CN,
forming the commissural connection with the contralateral \CN
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007}.  /In vitro/ studies have shown that \DS
cells are strongly regulated by the neurotransmitter GABA
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  Golgi cells are the only
GABAergic neuron in the VCN, but their axonal plexus does not extend
into the magnocellular core. \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997} found that all
DS cells labelled from BDA injections in the DCN had dendritic
projections that entered the GCD, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:DSinGCD}.

#+CAPTION: []{(Left) TS cells that were retrogradely labeled from injections in the DCN lie in the narrow frequency band corresponding to the presumed frequency band of the injection site in the DCN. Labeled DS cells were spread over the nucleus. (Right) All DS cells, labeled by \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997}, had dendritic processes extending into the granule cell domain. Large multipolar VCN neurons, DS cells, are known to have dendritic projections into the GCD, the location of GABAergic Golgi cells.   Images reproduced from Figure 3C in \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997}}.

This section describes the setting of network parameters and the intrinsic
cell properties that influence the behaviour of the \DS cell model.  
In the first optimisation, Section \ref{sec:Ch3:DSClickRecovery}, click recovery responses were used to optimise the \GABAa synapse and inputs to the \DS model.
In the second optimisation, Section \ref{sec:Ch3:DSRateLevel}, rate-level responses to tones and noise were used to optimise the parameters controlling excitation in the \DS model.

*** Morphology and Cellular Mechanisms of D Stellate Cells

#\DS cells are large multipolar neurons in the \VCN and have an \OnC
#\PSTH to tones and noise \citep{SmithRhode:1989,NeedhamPaolini:2006}.

Morphologically, DS cells typically have 3--4 long dendrites stretching
200 microns (or one third of the \VCN) and appear to integrate inputs
over a wide frequency range.  Their axonal collaterals cover the same
region in the \VCN, almost one half of the \DCN, and are one source of
the commissural projection to the contralateral cochlear nucleus
\citep{Cant:1992,Cant:1981,SchofieldCant:1996,CantBenson:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2007,PaoliniClark:1999}.
\citet{SmithMassieEtAl:2005} combined evidence from studies in different animals to suggest that radiate neurons in rats,
large Type II multipolar neurons in cats and guinea pigs, and D stellate neurons
in mice have the closest resemblance to glycinergic labeled \OnC units
\citep{DoucetRossEtAl:1999,DoucetRyugo:1997,CantGaston:1982,Wenthold:1987,KolstonOsenEtAl:1992,AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993,ShoreGodfreyEtAl:1992,SchofieldCant:1996,Alibardi:2000a,NeedhamPaolini:2003,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PaoliniClark:1999}.
#Hereafter they will be termed \DS cells in the \CNSM model.
# Intracellular responses to sounds indicate the bandwidth of inputs to
# \DS neurons typically ranges from two octaves below \CF to one octave
# above \CF
# \citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PaoliniClark:1999}.
# \DS cell axon terminals contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine
# and synapse widely in the \VCN and \DCN.  They also send a commissural
# projection to the contralateral cochlear nucleus that mediates fast
# inhibition between the nuclei
# \citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2006,Oertel:1997}.

\yellownote{Cellular properties}

*** Acoustic Properties of D Stellate Cells

\DS cells (and their equivalent large multipolar cells) have been
classified as having an \OnC \PSTH to \CF tones across many species
\citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983,BlackburnSachs:1989,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,Pfeiffer:1966,SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PaoliniClark:1999,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}.
Their high threshold to \CF tones and increased response to noise show
\DS cells receive inputs from many weak \ANFs across a wide frequency
range \citep{RhodeSmith:1986,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  Electrophysiological intracellular
responses /in vivo/ to sounds indicate that the bandwidth of \ANF inputs
to \DS neurons is asymmetric, with an estimated range of two octaves
below the \DS cells' \CF and one octave above \CF
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.


Post-onset GABAergic inhibition in \DS cells is a major influence on the
\PSTH of \OnC neurons \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
Iontopheroretic investigations /in vivo/ using bicuculine 
# (a \GABAa blocker) 
#by Caspary and colleagues \citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994} have
have shown the firing rate increases to tones and noise \citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994}. The \GABA effects on
\OnC units' response area are predominantly on \CF.  Application of
bicuculine in the \VCN has the effect of changing the temporal
behaviour in \DS cells \citep{EvansZhao:1998}, which also affects \AM
responses in the \IC
\citep{CasparyHelfertEtAl:1997,CasparyPalombiEtAl:2002}.  With click
pairs, \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997} showed strong \GABA inhibition
does not allow full click recovery in onset choppers until 16 ms
separation of the probe and mask clicks.

The \CNSM model assumes that \GABA-ergic input to \DS cells
is only from local, acoustically-driven Golgi cells.  The temporal
response of Golgi cells to \AM is unknown, therefore clicks and click
pairs \citep[as~used~by~][]{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997} were deemed the
most suitable for optimisation.  

# Latency of excitation to auditory nerve
# shocks suggests Golgi cells are activated by Type II \ANFs and low
# spontaneous rate Type I \ANFs
# \citep{BensonBerglundEtAl:1996,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
#   Therefore,
# Type II and \LSR Type I \ANFs could be involved in gain control through
# GABAergic modulation of activity in the \VCN.


# AM coding effects of GABA in the Chinchilla
# \CN \citep{BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999}. \citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994}
# Caspary and colleagues worked on the effects of \GABA in in the \VCN.
# Zhang and Winter looked at the response area of \VCN onset units to
# determine \GABA {on\slash off} freq.  Smith and Rhode, Smith and
# others looked at OnC response area and two-tone

** Implementation

# 2.5. Data analysis Data were collected as spike times with a
# resolution of 10 μs and analyzed off-line on a micro-VAX 3100
# (Digital). Response histograms were plotted and analyzed using a
# windowing technique in which spike counts were taken over brief time
# windows of identical duration for the masker and probe components
# (Fig. 1B). Using the control conditions, counting windows were
# determined individually for each unit but ranged between 1 and 4 ms
# based on the control response to the masker alone and the probe
# alone. To assess response variability over time, repeated unmasked
# controls for both the masker (masker alone, Ma) and probe (probe
# alone, Pa) were obtained during the pre-drug, drug, and post-drug
# recovery conditions. Drug doses were determined empirically as the
# lowest dose that elicited a reproducible and reversible effect. To
# allow normalization of the masked probe response obtained in the
# paired-click paradigm to the unmasked response obtained when the probe
# was presented alone, identical measurement windows were used in the
# control and drug conditions for a given unit. The suppression recovery
# functions for each unit were normalized by taking the ratio Pm/Pa
# where Pm is the masked probe spike count and Pa is the unmasked
# response to the probe (Fig. 1C).


The \DS neural model was implemented with a single-compartment, Type
I-II \RM model \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The Type I-II
\RM is unique to \DS cells due to the small presence of
low-threshold potassium currents.  A larger cell body diameter, average
25 \um \citep{SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, was included in
the model and conductance parameters were adjusted accordingly to keep
total-compartment conductance the same as the original values
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.

In order to specify how \ANF and \GABA-ergic inputs regulate the rate
and temporal behaviour of \DS cells, two optimisation routines were
performed.  The first optimisation used the click recovery
observed in \OnC units \citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, with and without
GABA, to investigate the temporal behaviour of the \DS cell model.  

DS cell rate level
responses to tones and noise \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004} were used in
the second optimisation.  Key elements in the creation of the D stellate
cell model are shown in the Nordlie Table \ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}A.
A Type I-II single compartment neuron by \citet{RothmanManis:2003b} has
the characteristics of a onset chopper unit and has previously been used
to simulate a \DS cell model.  The selection of a large multipolar
neuron without dendrites was based on computational efficiency and
ensuring that the model fitted within the criteria for \DS cells.  \DS cells have electrotonic dendrites and the filtering in \DS cells
primarily controls the height of excitatory \PSPs reaching the soma
\citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994}. Accordingly, a single compartment with graded
weights was sufficient for the \DS cell model.

#+LaTeX:\input{../SimpleResponsesChapter/DSRecoveryTable}


The synaptic connections onto the D stellate cell model, shown in Table
\ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}C, were simplified to afferent ANF inputs
and intra-nuclear co-localised GABAergic input from Golgi cells.  The
\DS cell model's input parameters were pre-emptively fixed.  These
included the number of \GLG to \DS synapses ($\nGLGDS = 25$), the spread
of \ANFs to \DS cells (\sANFDSh and \sANFDSl), and the conduction delay
from the auditory nerve (\dANFDS).  The \ANF spread onto \DS cells is
well documented
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
# The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the nucleus
# \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and in physiological studies the
# response area of \DS cell was approximately 1 octave above \CF and 2
# octaves below the \CF \citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
Due to the large computational task of calculating an optimisation
routine for \DS input bandwidth across the whole network.  The spread of
\ANF to \DS cells was split into a Gaussian distribution with spread
below (\sANFDSl=5) and spread above \CF (\sANFDSl=2.5). This approach
assumed average octave separation between channels of 0.4 octaves,
approximating the calculated response area \citep{PaoliniClark:1999}.

The additional delay parameter for \ANF terminals on the \DS cell model,
\dANFDS, was shown in Section \ref{sec:Ch3:Delays}.  The first spike
latency in high \CF \DS cells ($2.8 \pm 0.09$ ms) is precise and faster
than other stellate neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmith:1986}.  The
additional delay of 1.2 ms from \ANF to \DS input connections is a combination
of axonal conductance and dendritic delay.

The physiological effect of GABAergic inputs onto onset choppers is
primarily on \CF, but the bandwidth is difficult to ascertain
\citep{CasparyHaveyEtAl:1979,PalombiCaspary:1992,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,CasparyPalombi:1993,CasparyPalombiEtAl:1993}.
The dendrites of D stellate cells cover one third of the nucleus
(approximately 3 octaves of tonotopic frequencies) and occasionally
project into the \GCD \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.  Golgi cells'
axonal collaterals are confined to 200 \um in the \GCD. 
\yellownote{DS dendrite spread in GCD?}
###and \ANFtonotopic organisation in the \GCD is less defined.  
The Golgi to \DS connection spread
was set to 2 channels with zero offset, which corresponds to a \DS cell
selecting from the 5 nearest Golgi cells.


#+CAPTION: [Experimental data showing click recovery in onset choppers.]  {Experimental data showing click recovery in onset choppers. Figure shows mask/recovery response ratio using 1 ms window during GABA blocker experiments (reproduced from Figure 3 in \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997})}.

The \DS model was tested with six pairs of mask/recovery click pairs,
with intervals 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16 ms (consistent with 
\citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997} and the responses shown in Figure
\ref{fig:BackoffPalombi}).  \PSTHs of the spiking output of \DS units were
generated from 25 stimulus repetitions. Each response to a click was
measured for a period of 2 ms.  The sample period was delayed by 4 ms,
an estimate of the auditory delay and minimum first spike latency for
the DS unit.  The unit used in the optimisation had a CF = 5.8 kHz
(channel no. 50).   Spontaneous activity  in idle periods was used for additional weighted penalty 
measures of spontaneous activity and to restrict over-excitation by \ANFs.


# In order to specify how Golgi cells regulate the click recovery
# response in DS cells, a parameter optimisation routine was performed.
# Some \DS cells' input parameters were preemptively fixed.  These included the number

\yellownote{duplicate paragraph}
Optimisation parameters for Golgi cell inputs to \DS cells were optimised based on experimental
click recovery data from \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:BackoffPalombi}.  The input stimulus presented a series
of masker-probe clicks, with intervals of 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16 ms,
separated by 50 ms.  Although the experimental stimuli was presented
every 250 ms, the optimisation stimulus needed to be computationally
efficient so the separation was shortened and the sequence reordered to
obtain the best click recovery response in the \DS and Golgi cells.  The
stimulus was repeated 25 times and a PSTH was produced from the DS
cells' spikes.  Spike counts for 2 ms after the probe and masker click
were selected (accounting for the the minimum first spike latency for
the unit) to calculate a recovery ratio.  The \DS cell optimisation
function calculated the mean squared error between the test model and
the experimental data recovery ratios to 5 click pairs.

The six parameters to be fit by the routine were the weights of Golgi,
\HSR, and \LSR synapses on \DS, the \GABAa synapse rise constant, the
\GABAa synapse decay constant, and the \DS cell maximum leak conductance
(\gleak).  Initial optimisation procedures were not successful at
constraining the short delay recovery responses (2, 3, 4 ms), so the
\DS cells' \Ileak and \IKLT conductance parameters were included in the
optimised parameters to allow the model's input resistance behaviour to fit
fast-acting behaviour in the cell.
The unit used in the optimisation had a \CF of 5.8 kHz (equivalent to
channel number 50 in the CN network with 100 channels from 0.2 to 30
kHz).

Figures \ref{fig:DSClickRecoveryResult} shows the results of the final
parameters in the \DS click recovery optimisation routine.  The
optimisation parameters show a clear favouritism toward the \LSR input
rather than the \HSR input to \DS units.  While this may not seem ideal
for fast coincidence detection, the large number of \HSR synapses
compensates for the small weight that was obtained in the optimisation.

\yellownote{TODO:  Review this intro to RL optimisation.}

Rate level curves to \CF tones and noise have been used as a physiological measure of neurons auditory system since the earliest experiments \citep{RoseGalambosEtAl:1959,SachsYoung:1978}.
Rate level curves are used to determine the threshold, dynamic range and saturation rate in response to acoustic stimuli.

The dynamic range of DS cells (\OnC and \OnL units) is much larger than their primary afferent inputs (DS \gt 50 dB SPL, ANFs \lt 25 dB SPL) \citep{Joris:1998,Rhode:1994,RhodeSmith:1986}.
The rate level responses to \CF tones and broadband noise in an \OnC unit 
\citep[shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ArnottFig12}]{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, were used as the target data to fit the DS cell model.

The output of the DS cell model in the optimisation was strongly
determined by its input responses, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult} A and C.  \HSR fibres (all with \SR = 50 sp/s) 
have low threshold to sounds and saturate at moderate sound levels, as
shown by the stable rate level responses to tones and noise (orange
circles in Figures \ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult}). These flat responses at
a high rate (approximately 250 sp/s) were not able to manipulate the DS
cell model in the optimisation other than to set a threshold for tone
and noise sounds.  \LSR fibres (SR=0.1 sp/s) and \GLG units have  much higher
thresholds and  wider dynamic ranges.

The optimised parameters for inputs to the D stellate cell model were
applied to \DS cells across the whole network using tones, noise and
tones plus noise stimuli.  The behaviour of the \DS cell model output is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}, similar to the Golgi cell model (Figure
\ref{fig:Golgiverification}).  Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}A and B
shows the response of the central \DS cell model (CF=5.8 kHz). 
# The onset PSTH
# monotonic responses to tones and noise were similar to other Ghoshal and Kim
# units (Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}).  

Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}C
shows the wide response of all \DS units in the network to a 5.8 kHz
tone for increasing sound level.  Adding masking noise increased the
width of the activity across the CF of the central unit (Figure
\ref{fig:DSverification}D), highlighting the broad inputs of \ANFs onto
\DS cells.

** Background

# Alibardi:2003 In layer 3 of the DCN, glycinergic vertical neurons are present,
# and they have specific nuclear and synaptic characteristics that distinguish
# them from Golgi-stellate cells present in the same layer (Saint-Marie et
# al. 1991; Wickesber & Oertel, 1993; Alibardi, 1999b, 2000a). Vertical (or
# tuberculo-ventral) neurons form a local circuit that connects the dorsal to
# the ventral cochlear nuclei, and also contact the basal dendrites of pyramidal
# cells (Saint-Marie et al. 1991, 1993; Wickesberg & Oertel, 1993; Ferragamo et
# al. 1998).


# Tuberculoventral neurons in the deep layer of the \DCN provide a delayed,
# frequency-specific glycinergic inhibition to TS and DS cells in the \VCN
# \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1988}.  The dendrites of TV cells are
# aligned with \ANFs and indicating narrow frequency tuning. TV cells have low
# spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs; “pauser,” “chopper,” or
# “onset/sustained” have been recorded
# \citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
# response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are
# non-monotonic functions of intensity.

# Anterograde labelling in the \DCN suggests glycinergic Tuberculoventral cells
# project tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-\CF, but also to the adjacent
# low and high frequency side bands in the \AVCN
# \citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004}.  Ultra-structural
# labelling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggest \TV cells are inhibited by DS
# cells and from sources in the \DCN but excitatory inputs were not found from
# TS cells \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.  Intracellular responses from labeled TV
# cells in the mouse show clear excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse
# inhibitory input from DS cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.

*** Morphology and Cellular Properties of Tuberculoventral Cells

\TV cells are glycinergic, inhibitory cells found in the deep layers of
the \DCN forming synaptic local circuits with pyramidal cells and sending
axon collaterals to the \VCN. The dendrites of \TV cells are aligned with
\ANFs, giving them an alternate name `vertical' cells, and indicating
narrow frequency tuning \citep{Rhode:1999}.  They are characterised as having unique cell
bodies and synaptic characteristics that distinguish them from other
cells in the deep layer, namely Giant cells and Golgi-stellate cells
\citep{SaintBensonEtAl:1991,WickesbergOertel:1993,Alibardi:2000b,Alibardi:1999}.

Intracellular responses of \TV cells to injected currents are linear, regularly
spaced action potentials, indicating TV cells are simple integrators
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}. 
The input resistance of TV cells ranges from 80 to 125 M\Omega \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,Manis:1990}.  

# the low spontaneous
# rates and high sound thresholds of Type II \DCN units might be caused by
# a high intrinsic electrical threshold \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997};
# this is consistent with the responses of vertical cells to intracellular
# current injection \citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.

Anterograde labeling in the \DCN suggests \TV cells project
tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-CF, but also to the low and high
frequency side bands
\citep{MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.  With
retrograde labelling in the \DCN three types of ventro-tubercular units
in rats were identified \citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}, compared
with only two types in cats \citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.
These units are identified as \TS and \DS cells, with the third in rats
identified as small adendritic neurons.
\TV cells receive weak mono-synaptic excitatory input, mainly on their
dendrites, from \ANFs
\citep{OertelWu:1989,ZhangOertel:1993b}.  

Ultra-structural labeling of
synapses in the rat \DCN suggests that \TV cells are inhibited by glycinergic
\DS cells and from sources in the \DCN \citep{Rubio:2005}.
Intracellular responses from labeled \TV cells in the mouse show clear
diffuse inhibitory input from \DS cells
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1993}.  Evidence in the mouse
suggests \TV cells also receive excitation from \TS cells
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1993}, however \citet{Rubio:2005} found
no \TS terminals on rat \TV cells.
  
*** Acoustic Response of Tuberculoventral cells

\TV cells have low spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs (pauser,
chopper, wide-chopper or onset/sustained) have been recorded
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999}.

The complex physiological characteristics of \DCN neurons are
categorised into \EIRA groups
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,YoungBrownell:1976}.  Type I \EIRA units reflect
the responses of single \ANFs.  \TV cells have a non-monotonic response
to tones with increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband
noise, categorised as a Type II \EIRA unit
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}.  Units
with Type II \EIRA responses are sharply tuned; have thresholds 10 dB higher
than other units with which they are intermingled; and do not
respond to broad-band noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungBrownell:1976,Young:1980,SachsYoung:1980,YoungVoigt:1982,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1990,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,Rhode:1999}.
Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1} shows the recording of a single \TV cell,
with narrow tuning and weak response to noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.
#\TV cells are characterized as having a non-monotonic response to
#tones with increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband
#noise \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005},
#as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1}.
# Young and his colleagues have shown that most neurons in the deep DCN
# respond to sound with either of two major types of response maps, type
# II or Type IV
# \citep{EvansNelson:1973,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1980,VoigtYoung:1990,Young:1980,YoungBrownell:1976}.

# Responses of tuberculoventral neurons to sound
Recorded \PSTHs of \TV cells /in vivo/ are variable (pause-build,
unusual chopper, or onset with sustained activity)
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  Recordings /in vitro/
show that tuberculoventral cells respond with regular chopper-like
behaviour to voltage-clamped current injection
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.  The strong input from \DS cells across
frequencies contributes  little or no response to wide band noise and
firing rates to \CF tones that are non-monotonic functions of intensity.
The low spontaneous rates and high sound thresholds of Type II \DCN
units might be caused by a high intrinsic electrical threshold
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}; this is consistent with the responses of
\TV cells to intracellular current injection
\citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.


Pharmacological effects of neurotransmitter blockers have shown that \TV
cells (Type II \DCN units) are strongly regulated by glycinergic and
GABA-ergic inputs. TV cells' zero spontaneous activity is still
maintained despite application of glycinergic or \GABAa blockers
\citep{DavisYoung:2000}. In reponse to sounds, strychnine and
bicuculine enabled TV cells to respond more vigorously to noise and
lowered the threshold for tones \citep{DavisYoung:2000}.



Taken together with histological studies, the results suggest that
\ANFs (predominantly \LSR fibres) form the major
excitatory input to Type II \DCN units along with other excitation from TS cells.  
# If true, this hypothesis could also explain the finding that
# Type II DCN units have consistently higher thresholds than \DCN
# principal cells \citep{YoungBrownell:1976} because \LSR fibres \citep{Liberman:1978}.  However, patterns
# of also have elevated thresholds relative to the lowest threshold
# auditory nerve innervation of the \DCN are most consistent with \HSR
# fibre innervation of \TV cell somata and \LSR fibre innervation of
# dendrites \citep{Liberman:1993}.  In that case, 
Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the \VCN
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but the role of Type II terminals in the
\VCN is less clear.  Three different hypotheses have been raised.  The
first is that this projection modulates the response thresholds of \VCN
neurons \citep{PaoliniClark:1998}.  Secondly, the role of Type II units in
spectral processing maybe that of a narrowband inhibitor. Responses of \DCN
principal cells are strongly inhibited by this narrowband source.  As a
result, \DCN principal cells are inhibited by sharp spectral peaks close
to their \BF \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.

*** Modelling of Tuberculoventral cells


\yellownote{ Expand previous studies of the DCN incl. TV cells}

\citet{ArleKim:1991a} were the first to show Type II \EIRA units with
  simple McCullock-Pitts point neuron models of the \DCN.
 - (From Hancock Davis Voigt 97) Blum et al. (1995) used a wideband
  inhibitory mechanism to create Type II unit responses in a model of
  the DCN\. In that model, each cell population was described by a
  mathematical formula for its steady-state rate-level function. This
  level of abstraction was used to focus specifically on the role of
  network connectivity in determining the steady-state behavior of
  DCNunits. The level of abstraction employed in our model allows for
  examination of temporal response properties including PST histograms
  and cross-correlation analysis.
 - \citep{DunnVetterEtAl:1996} performed some modelling.
 - Most recent models from \citep{LomakinDavis:2008} and \citep{ReissYoung:2005}

Modelling of Type II units in the \DCN has been thoroughly investigated by
Davis and colleagues
\citep{YoungDavis:2002,HancockDavisEtAl:2001,DavisYoung:2000,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,DavisVoigt:1996,DavisVoigt:1994,DavisVoigt:1991}.





To create a neural model with low spontaneous rate requires either increasing
the intrinsic spiking threshold or lowering the synaptic strength of the
inputs.  Intracellular observations in decerebrate gerbils show higher
thresholds in Type II units \citep{DingVoigt:1997} and intracellularly
recorded Type II units.  Another cause for Type II behaviour of no
spontaneous activity, is a preference of \LSR \ANFs over \HSR fibres.
Whether \LSR fibres
preference the deep layers of the \CN is yet to be confirmed
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

# - \citep{Rhode:1999} Vertical cells in gerbils (mainly Type III)

The intrinsic mechanism is more favourable in Type II units, provided
there is sufficient inhibition and excitation
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}.  Consistent with previous \TV cell models
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}, the \CNSM model used the wide-band
inhibition of \DS cells onto \TV cells.  Studies of the circuitry of the
\DCN have shown that wide-band inhibition is necessary for accurate
modeling of the principal cells of the \DCN including Type II units
\citep{ReedBlum:1995,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReed:1998}.

** Implementation

The implementation of the \TV cell model used in the \CNSM model and its optimisation routines are described in Table \ref{tab:TVModelSummary}.
The \TV cell model was implemented with a single-compartment
conductance neural model of Type I-c, a classic regular firing unit
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The synaptic inputs to the \TV cell model
included excitation from \HSR and \LSR \ANFs, and inhibition from \DS cells.
The weights (\wLSRTV, \wHSRTV) and number (\nLSRTV, \nHSRTV) of \ANF
synapses were used in the optimisation procedures to allow for coarse
and fine adjustments to the strength of excitation. The TV cell model
received \ANF inputs from only one frequency channel at the same CF
(\sANFTV=0).  The strength of inhibition in the \TV cell model was
controlled by the weight and number of \DS cell inputs (\wDSTV,
\nDSTV). These parameters were included in the rate level
optimisation. The parameters controlling the distribution of \DS cell
inputs to \TV cells were fixed (\sDSTV=3, \oDSTV=0) in the rate level
optimisation and are the focus of the next section of this chapter,
Section \ref{sec:Ch3:DSTV}.  The reversal potential of TV cells
(E$_{{rev}}$) was also optimised to allow modulation of the level of the
resting membrane potential from the default Type I \RM
neural model.

** Results

Figure \ref{fig:TVRateLevelResult} shows the best fitted output behaviour of
the optimised TV cell model (Table \ref{tab:TVRateLevelFig8B}) and its
inputs to target data from the unit in Figure 8A in
\citet{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} (see Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig8}). The
target unit had an elevated threshold to noise relative to \BF tones and
no change in threshold when strychnine was applied.  The optimised TV
cell model was able emulate this response in tones but not in noise
(Figure \ref{fig:TVRLresult}D).

The optimised parameters for inputs to the \TV cell model were
applied to all \TV units across the whole network using tones, noise and
tones plus noise stimuli.  Unlike the Golgi cell model, the rate-level
response of TV cells is non-linear and the noise rate-level is mostly inhibited (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A).  This is typical of the Type II
\EIRA units in the deep layer of the \DCN
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999}.  The PSTH response of the
central \TV unit (CF=5.8 kHz) at 90 dB \SPL is a simple chopping
response, characteristic of the Type I-c \RM neural model (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}A) \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The minimum first
spikes occur at 4.3 ms after the stimulus onset (similar to the
un-optimised \TV model's mean \FSL in Section \ref{sec:Ch3:Delays}). Due
to the strong \DS inhibition, the peak \FSL of the optimised \TV cell
model is delayed to 6.5 ms for a 50 dB SPL tone (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}A). In response to loud noise, the onset spike
and the chopping behaviour is suppressed (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}B).
# The \TV model outputs' behaviour
# is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}, similar to the Golgi cell
# model Figure \ref{fig:Golgiverification}.  
Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A and B show the response of the central
\TV model (CF=5.8 kHz). The PSTH in Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}B is
a wide chopper, generated from regular firing Type I-c \RM neural model and
the strong onset inhibition from DS cells.  Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}C shows the wide response of all \TV units in
the network to a 5.8 kHz tone with increasing sound level.  The masked
response curves (Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}D) show the wide-band
inhibition particularly for tones above \CF. The responses of all \TV
units to pure tones replicate the single channel excitatory inputs from
\ANFs and wide-band inhibition from \DS units (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}C and D).

* Asymmetry in Wide-band Inhibition to TV Cells Using Notch Noise Responses: Optimisation of D Stellate to Tuberculoventral Cell Connection Offset  
  :PROPERTIES:
  :LABEL: sec:Ch3:DSTV
  :END:

** Background

The increase in rate of TV cells in regions below the frequency of the
notch is the main argument for the assertion of offset in DS to TV
cell connections.

\yellownote{TODO: think about combining this section with TV model optimisation}

[[../../cnstellate/TV_Notch/Reiss_Fig9_E+F.png]]

** Implementation

Table \ref{tab:TVNotchModelSummary} shows the implementation parameters
for the optimisation of \DS cell connections to \TV cells.  
# The experimental data used in the fitness function, from
# \citet{ReissYoung:2005} recorded from individual \TV neurons, is
# adapted for a range of \TV cell models using a single notch stimulus.
The experimental data (Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9}) are the
average responses of Type II \DCN units to notch sweeps
\citep{ReissYoung:2005}.  The optimisation routine would be prohibitive
if it used a notch sweep simulated on a single neuron; therefore, this
optimisation uses a single notch presentation across an entire network
of TV cells.  Accordingly, the fitness function must take into account
the relative position of cells in the network when comparing the
experimental data.  For example, when presented with a notch noise
filtered between 5 kHz and 10 kHz, a unit with \CF of 5 kHz will see a
falling edge of a 1 octave notch, whereas a unit with \CF of 10 kHz, will
see a rising edge of a half octave notch.  Figure
\ref{fig:TVNotchDiagram} shows the combination of the type \DCN II unit
notch data for 1 octave.

#+CAPTION: [TV model optimisation configuration]{Expected mean rate response to  notch noise in the TV cells is created from 1 octave notch sweeps (top) for  the falling edge and from half octave notch sweeps (bottom) for the rising  edge (top and bottom figures from Figure 9 in \citet{ReissYoung:2005}).}
#+LABEL: fig:TVNotchDiagram
[[../SimpleResponsesChapter/gfx/TV_NotchDataConfig2.pdf]]


The notch sweep sets used by \citeauthor{ReissYoung:2005} were generated
with logarithmically constant notch widths and notch centre frequencies
ranging from 1 octave below to 1 octave above \CF in $1/50$ octave
steps.  The single notch noise stimulus presented in this optimisation
routine was generated in [[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using frozen Gaussian noise
(100 kHz sampling rate) and a Chebyshev Type II band reject filter.[fn::
The \textsf{[[latex:progname][cheby2}]] function is in the octave-forge signal package and
MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox.]  The sound level in the
\citet{ReissYoung:2005} data adds further complexity.  The
power spectrum was maintained at a constant level per frequency band (dB
per Hz$^{1/2}$) and this was scaled at each point in the notch
sweep.  For a single presentation used in this experiment the sound
level plays an important part in stimulating the \ANFs and contributing
interneurons. From the previous optimisation (Section \ref{sec:Ch3:TVModel}
# [[*Tuberculoventral Cell Model: Optimisation Using Tone and Noise Rate Level Responses]]
), the preliminary response to noise
in \TV cell models was linear between 40 to 80 dB SPL.


Higher thresholds in Type II \DCN units \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} and
the presence of multiple inhibitory synapses \citep{Alibardi:2006}
suggest \TV cells either receive a strong inhibitory influence or they
have a lower \RMP due to a lower leak current reversal potential. A
reduced resting membrane potential may increase the threshold for
excitatory inputs to generate action potentials. To allow for this, the
reversal potential of the TV cell model (\Erev) was used as a parameter
in the optimisation routine with a range from -80 to -50 mV. 

# \yellownote{TODO: I allowed HSR2TV weight value go negative to give a constant
# inhibitory input. Then on 2 other runs I shifted the reversal potential of the
# leak current to $-70$ and $-75$.}

The major challenge for the optimisation of mean rate responses in a
neural population is that the model could be over simplified and
therefore remove timing information.  The \HSR fibre rate response is
generally flat at medium-to-high sound intensities.  \DS cell responses
in the \CNSM model had a regular onset spike but a low rate throughout
the stimulus, which detracts from the use of using a whole network to
optimise parameters for synaptic inputs regarding \TV cells.  The \TV
cell model's rate response could therefore be modeled on the \LSR
response using a simple gradient-decent method of optimisation in future
work.

\yellownote{TODO: Population mean rate: Pros: fairly stable for smallish
repetitions, Cons: removes timing}

\yellownote{TODO}
Complicated issues in \TV model optimisation:
- Input model: reverting back to original Zilany model (2006-2007)
- Golgi model: from previous tests
- \DS model: from previous tests.  Sustained portion does not fire
  enough even at high notch level (SPL=90).  \TV response heavily
  dependant on \DS input.
- \TV model: Difficult to reconstruct model by changing number or
  offset during optimisation.
- \TV model: \DS2TV connections are STILL randomly selected given
  number, spread and offset
  - connections can be fixed by using mean and Pd, but this discrete
    method can be crude
- Experimental data: rate vs notch position is relative to \BF of unit
- Experimental data: sound level dependant on \BF and notch position,
  this means that the relative spectrum level may be variable along
  the network

# By setting the reversal potential of \TV cells to $-75$ mV, the optimisation
# produced the following results in Figure \ref{fig:TVresultErev75}. In this
# figure, the \TV rate-place profile gains no benefit from the reduced reversal
# potential.  Some contributing factors that may explain the poor optimisation
# performance are the low firing of \DS cells and the notch stimulus sound level
# remained at 90 dB \SPL.

The first set of parameters (\nDSTV, \wDSTV, \nLSRTV, \nHSRTV, \wLSRTV,
\wHSRTV) were run three times to strengthen the validity of the
optimisation results.  The major outcomes of  
this set's results are
the dominance of \LSR fibre excitatory inputs over \HSR fibres and the
large counter-balance of \DS cell inhibition on \TV cells.  The second
set of parameters (\sDSTV, \Eleak \oDSTV, \nDSTV, \wDSTV) were run for
an additional three runs to stabilise the \DSTV parameters.  \nDSTV and
\wDSTV were included in both sets and showed a large decrease due to the
effect of the \TV cell's leak reversal potential \Eleak scaling down to
-75 mV.

The eventual result of the offset parameter ($\oDSTV = 22.03$) was
unexpected.  The offset is equivalent in octaves of 2.5 octaves at the
lowest channel to 1.45 at the highest channel.  \citet{ReissYoung:2005}
predicted the offset to be 0.3 octaves, which would be between 2 to 4
channels depending on the location in the network.  This is most likely
caused by a local minimum in the optimisation and noise in the model
prevented the routine from finding lower scores.

\yellownote{TODO: The final error score was best in 70dB runs, but this is
not exactly what I wanted. The 22 dB SPL in Reiss fit the TV
rate-level response around mid way.}

The eventual result of the \DS to \TV connection optimisation,
highlighted in Table \ref{tab:TVDSfinal}, was derived from Run 1A and
Run 1B in the set using 70 dB \SPL stimulus.  The optimisation produced
a better result for the offset parameter and the overall error value of
the fitness function.  The offset of \DS onto \TV cells at 2.1 channels,
equivalent to a mean of 0.14 octaves (0.34 octaves at the lowest channel
and 0.13 at the highest channel), is closer to the offset predicted by
\citet{ReissYoung:2005}.

The results in the first set (Optimisation A) show the dominance of \LSR
over \HSR fibres in the number of synapses (29 to 1) and the increased
need for \DS cell inhibition with a high \nDSTV.  \LSR fibres have not
been proven to preference the deep layers of the \DCN
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

** Verification of Notch Sweep Response in the TV Cell Model 


The response of individual Type II units to notch and band-pass sweeps
in Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9} 
\citep[from Figure 9 in][]{ReissYoung:2005} was the target data used for the
optimisation of \DS cell connections to \TV cells.  To replicate the
response of a single unit to notch sweeps, notches were generated in
[[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using Chebychev II filters with a sampling rate of 100
kHz and an optimal filter number.  The half octave sweep was calculated
from -2 to 2 octaves away from 12.7 kHz at 1/32$^{nd}$ increments with
logarithmically constant notch widths. A 50 ms stimulus at 50 dB SPL was
established in the \AN model for use by the \CN stellate model.[fn::
Logarithmically constant means the notch width is calculated at the
centre frequency of the notch and not the \CF of the unit of interest.]
Figure \ref{fig:TVSweepUnit70} shows the response of a unit with similar
\CF (\TV unit 70, CF=12.76 kHz) to notch and band-pass noise.

* T Stellate Cell Model: Optimisation of Three Chopper Subtypes Using CF Tones 

Accurate modelling of the cochlear nucleus, in particular chopper
units and T stellate cells.

** Background

\yellownote{TODO: Expand background}

A considerable amount of literature has been published on the T stellate
cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus.  The first extracellular
physiology studies classified supposed \TS cells into regular-firing
choppers \citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1966}.  With further developments in
analysis and classification techniques, \TS cells were segregated into
slowly or transiently adapting and sustained chopper sub-types
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  In cats,
\citet{SmithRhode:1989} was the first to do simultaneous labelling of
\TS cells and confirmed the physiological response of Type I multipolar
neurons into choppers.  This simultaneous classification and labelling
was followed by others in gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}, guinea pigs
\citep{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and rats
\citep{PaoliniClarkEtAl:1997,PaoliniClark:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}. In
each of the studies, there was no morphological properties that
segregated transient and sustained choppers, which indicate synaptic
inputs play a strong role in output of \TS cells.

Averaging intracellular responses to acoustic input to determine
stochastic excitatory\slash inhibitory inputs was first used in the
chopper units of gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}.
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005} used similar averaging of \TS and DS cell
intracellular responses in rats as the basis for a thorough statistical
analysis to separate chopper units into three distinct subtypes.  Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} shows the intracellular acoustic classification of
chopper units in the rat into three distinct types
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}: ChS chopper sustained, and two transient
choppers, ChT1 and ChT2.  The intracellular traces in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} along with the CV statistics Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata} will form the basis for the optimisation routine
of the \TS cell model of each chopper type.

The categorisation via coefficient of variation is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata}.  Sustained choppers maintain a stable CV below
0.2 throughout the entire stimulus. The transient chopper optimisation
had two types defined by \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The first CT
type is categorised with CV starting below 0.2 then rising, hence the
name transient, but stays below 0.3.  The second CT type is regular in
the first 10 ms period, but rises to 0.3 or above throughout the
stimulus.

*** Fitness Function

The optimisation fitness function, $F$, of the T stellate cell model
calculated the relative error between a combination of the
intracellular and spikes statistics against the experimental data by
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.
Spike trains were collected for 25 repetitions of a 50 ms \CF tone and analysed for \PSTH characteristics \citep{Pfeiffer:1966a,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.
Chopper \PSTHs without the first three regular spikes were ignored.
Coefficient of variation of the inter-spike intervals was calculated
over 10 ms windows \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  
The intracellular voltage statistics included the onset ratio (Equation \ref{eq:IVstats-Onset}),
adaptation shift (Equation \ref{eq:IVstats-Adap}) and offset shift (Equation \ref{eq:IVstats-Offset}). 
The fitness value was a square root of the mean squared errors between the computed \AIV and CV statistics of the target units and the simulated \TS model.
The final fitness value had
additional penalties for \SR above 10 spikes per second and for \CV
values above 0.3 in the first 10 ms and above 0.4 for the remaining
stimulus.

** Optimisation Results

\yellownote{TODO: Choosing optimisation data - average population data or
individual exemplar based on Paolini rat data.}

What is not shown in Figure \ref{fig:TSinputs} the non-linear dynamics
of the action potential in the neural model. The hyperpolarisation
activation of \Ih and \IKA currents due to inhibitory input are not
evident.  The second factor is important in enhancing the first spike
response across the T stellate cells \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004} to
an oncoming stimulus, since the \OnC units will respond earlier and
provide fast inhibition.

The final error for the optimisation routine was calculated as the
square root of the mean squared error between the first 4 CV periods
and the three voltage measures.  The measures of membrane voltage were
independent of \RMP included a) the onset ratio
(Eq. \ref{eq:IVstats-Onset}), b) adaptation of sustained
depolarisation (Eq. \ref{eq:IVstats-Adap}), and c) post-tone
hyperpolarisation (Eq. \ref{eq:IVstats-Offset}).

*** Sustained Chopper

\glsreset{ChS} Figure \ref{fig:CSresults} shows the optimisation
results for the \ChS unit 01-864-004 from
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}, with \CF 3.9 kHz.  This unit had a
depolarisation threshold at 10 dB and a firing rate saturation at 75
dB \SPL.  The stimulus for the optimisation routine was a pure tone 30
dB above depolarisation threshold at \CF (3.9 kHz 40 dB \SPL), 5 ms
on\slash off cosine squared ramp.  A 20 ms delay was included to allow
the model to reach a sustained \RMP. The ChS model unit had CF of
3.872 kHz due to the separation of frequency channels in the model.
The best parameters found by the optimisation and shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CSresults}, were very high excitatory input (\wLSRTS =
2.86796 nS, \wHSRTS = 2.01089 nS) and moderate to high inhibition
(\wDSTS 0.291181 nS, \wTVTS 0.884174 nS, \wGLGTS 0.749812 nS).  A low
input stimulus level means that the majority of synaptic input came
from \HSR fibres.  There was a slight increase in the leak conductance
($\gleak=6.57345e-4 \textrm{S/cm}^2$ ) from the initial value
(4.907e-4), causing a decrease in the input resistance to 120
M$\Omega$ from 163 M$\Omega$.  The final error, calculated with more
weight on the CV variables, was 0.839952.  Post-tone hyperpolarisation
(reference 1.30035, best \ChS model -0.029843) and the first \CV value
(ref 0.1543, best \ChS model 0.49706) had the greatest difference.
The poor initial \CV response is due to the irregular first spike.
The large excitatory \HSR input causes spikes occurring after tone
onset, just before the stimulus invoked spike arrival at the \TS cell
3 ms later, but still included in the \CV calculation.

\yellownote{TODO: Note the ChS optimisation had added weight to the CV values
in the error calculation.  The PSTH and IV trace do not even show a
decent chopping behaviour.}  \yellownote{TODO: The peaks for the IV are 3.66,
6.77, and 10.99 ms. The AN model input is affected by the rat audiogram,
the low CF and low level.  This shifts the arrival time of spikes to the
TS model, and a raw IV comparison would need to be shifted by approx 2
ms. The onset ratio and the first CV value are effected by this.}

\yellownote{TODO: Synaptic weight in the model above 0.002 will initiate a
spike at each input spike, similar to the calyx synapse on bushy
cells. This means that the TS cell will respond with a primary-like or
primary with notch PSTH. Dendritic filtering could improve this but the
high synaptic weights do not seem like a realistic physiological option
for small bouton endings in the CN.}

\yellownote{TODO: The RMP of the experimental data was relatively high, and if
this was produced in a model the spontaneous rate would be close to 100
spikes per seconds.  The IV measures allow for comparison of the
experimental and model data that is independent of the RMP.}

\yellownote{TODO: Hand tuning creates many types of ChS models, but the best
effects are when you smooth out the input with dendritic filtering.
This can be used in a single compartment using a higher time constant on
the synapse or better, using a double-exponential synapse with longer
onset and decay time constants. Very high excitatory inputs saturates
the cell and it will spike repeatedly in a regular fashion but the onset
is too precise. See ChT2 IV trace for an example of precise onset. I was
able to generated a good IV trace when the full trace was the error
function at higher SPL and higher CF, but this was unable to generate
the same trace for 3.9 KHz at 40 dB or a sustained CV. }

*** Transient Chopper 1

The \ChT1 unit chosen for the optimisation was unit 01-857-007, CF=8.2
kHz \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The depolarisation threshold for
this unit was 55 dB \SPL, close to the average 47.2 dB \SPL for all
\ChT1 units.  The stimulus for the optimisation routine was an 85 dB 8.2
kHz pure tone and the exemplar \TS cell model had CF 8.27 kHz.

The optimisation results of \ChT1 ares shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CT1results} with a final error of 0.839141 without weighting.
Moderate excitatory synaptic weights (\wLSRTS 0.000822193, \wHSRTS
0.000620294) is balanced with moderate to low glycinergic synaptic input
(\wDSTS 0.000148518, \wTVTS 0.000195416).  The GABAergic input weight
was very low (\wGLGTS 1.70742e-05), but the loud input stimulus (85 dB)
would cause reasonable inhibition to the \TS cell throughout the
stimulus.  The leak conductance had a slight decrease (\gleak
0.000409819).

*** Transient Chopper 2

The exemplar \ChT2 unit (01-305-014, CF 12.4 kHz
\citep*{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}), has a low depolarising threshold (5
dB \SPL) so the stimulus is set to 35 dB \SPL.  This second
transiently adapting chopper unit's difference to \ChT1 is reflected
in its average membrane potential and \CV.  \ChT2 has a higher
reduction in onset depolarization (90.2\%) compared to ChT1, and
post-tone inhibition is greater (8.82 mV).

* Discussion 

\yellownote{TODO: Discuss the relevance of creating the CN stellate model,
  especially the methods.}

The T stellate cell microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus is one of the
most interesting neural features of the auditory system.  It enables a
high fidelity sensory input to be passed to higher order centres, by
reproducing the spectrum in a robust fashion
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003} and synchronisation to significant
periodic frequencies \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

\yellownote{TODO: Discuss the Golgi cell optimisation.  Is the filter-based
  approach effective at meeting the goal of simulating data from
  GhoshalKim:1997. The Golgi cell model optimised in Section
  \ref{sec:GolgiModelOpt} reproduces the experimental data of a single unit in
  the marginal shell of the VCN \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.}

between TS/DS/TV the most important?  Mammalian studies show that the
TV cells receive input from TS cells, but not in rats}

*** Chopper Subtypes: T Stellate Cell Models

The primary purpose of this optimisation study set out with the aim of
pin-pointing the network parameters that regulate the major output of
the CN stellate microcircuit.




** Limitations of the CN stellate microcircuit model

All \BNN models are limited by a number of factors.  Firstly, the level
of detail in the neural models set the underlying complexity and
dynamics that are possible within the \BNN.  Secondly, the connectivity
and synaptic parameters, which set the network dynamics, are often
hand-tuned or guessed. And lastly, the background and driving inputs to
the network set the environmental conditions for genuine realistic
models to be compared with experimental animal network under the same
conditions and inputs.

The level of detail in the neural models of the \CNSM model includes the
complex channel dynamics of a \HH conductance model.  Three potassium
current channels (\IKHT, \IKLT, and \IKA) and the mixed cation
hyperpolarisation current (\Ih) were fit precisely from \VCN neurons in
mice \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}.
More complex multi-compartment conductance model could have been chosen
to include dendritic filtering, especially in \DS and \TS cells, and
already present in existing stellate models
\cite{WangSachs:1995,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}.
Dendritic filtering in each of the cells was not included 


\yellownote{TODO: AM coding in model is not verified by
\citet{ZilanyBruce:2006} model, and it was superseded by the addition
of a power-law functions in the synapse \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}}




** Implications of sequential microcircuit optimisation

connection) not included.}

* Conclusion 

[[*Optimisation%20Results][Optimisation Results]]

# Example conclusion The purpose for performing the experiments herein
# was to gain insights into the functional relevance of the Type II
# neurons by analyzing their endogenous firing features. The observed
# electrophysiological diversity between the two classes of primary
# auditory neurons argues for different roles for the Type I and II
# neurons. In contrast to the Type I spiral ganglion neurons, the type
# II neurons show markedly distinct kinetics and receive a classically
# convergent innervation pattern that is also present in other sensory
# systems. Like the rod neural circuitry in the retina, the Type II
# spiral ganglion neurons appear to be designed to integrate input
# from the many receptors that they innervate. This would have very
# little impact, however, on signal detection without the process of
# temporal summation. The slow kinetics of the Type II spiral ganglion
# neurons, along with their ability to respond at relatively
# hyperpolarized voltage levels, are features consistent with mechanisms
# designed to detect low-intensity stimuli.

\yellownote{TODO: More editing in chapter conclusion}

The purpose for performing the optimisation experiments herein was to
develop a biophysically-realistic neural network model of the stellate
microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus.  The methods used in this section
are a practical and realistic means for constructing microcircuits with
sensory or feature-based topography; but requires extensive experimental
evidence about the behaviour of each interneuron in the network.  The
tabular reporting format for neural network modelling, as suggested by
\citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009}, was followed so that other researchers
can easily reproduce this work.
