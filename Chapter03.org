#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ``To understand brain function, the focus of [our] investigations
  must expand from detailed responses and structure of single cells to
  include unit responses to the activity of other cells, and how these
  responses are distributed over a population of similar cells as
  wells as across populations of different cells.''  -

Shihab Shamma calls upon the science community, particularly members
of its physiology and neuroscience subgroups, to investigate the role
of populations of neurons and to pay attention to the role of
populations of neurons in neurophysiology.  This chapter draws on the
wealth of experimental data accumulated in auditory neuroscience to
create a detailed, \BNN model of the cochlear nucleus stellate cell
network.  The design and methods for the construction of the model
shall provide insights relevant to other neural network models of the
brain, especially those that use highly-specific sensory pathways.

It still remains a laborious task to develop an accurate representation
of complex behaviour of real neural networks.  Pre-eminent computational
neuroscientists have noted that "choices, assumptions, and guesses" are
an integral part of neuronal modelling \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}.  With
the acceleration of computational power and enhanced experimental
techniques in multi-unit recordings are enabling more detailed neural
models to be developed.  There is much to be gained from
biophysically-realistic modelling approaches, especially in the
thoroughly investigated cochlear nucleus of mammals, bats and birds.

# \yellownote{See neural detail in auditory
# system\citep{LuRubioEtAl:2008}} \yellownote{Discuss use of Poisson
# models vs HH-like models.  Discuss single cell simulation vs whole
# network simulation during optimisation.}

To develop and optimise detailed neural models and neural network
models, reproducible research methods are required.  Examples of
parameter estimation and fitting in neural models are also becoming
more advanced, for example [[latex:progname][SSNS]] \citep{SichtigSchafferEtAl:2008},
[[latex:progname][NeuroFitter]] \citep{VanAchardEtAl:2007} and [[latex:progname][MultiRunFitter]] (a feature
in NEURON).  In this chapter, a table method introduced by
\citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is used to summarise the neural
models used in each optimisation step.  The Nordlie tables shown in
each optimisation stage consist of A) the model summary, B) cell type
populations, C) connectivity between two cell types, D) neuron and
synapse models, and E) optimisation parameters.  This method aims to
show a consistent and recognisable format for presenting various
neural network models and their constituents.

# \yellownote{this needs more explanation in the methods sections}

The standard methods for optimisation can be simply described with the
following steps:
 1. specify the function or model we want to optimise,
 2. specify the criteria we want to satisfy,
 3. specify the parameters that will be adjusted, and any constraints
on those parameters, and finally
 4. perform the optimization.

In attempting to create a realistic microcircuit the parameter
optimisation routine, these steps need to be reiterated in sequential
stages.  The parameters chosen in the sequential optimisation stages
should be chosen so that they do not influence the properties of
previously fitted parameters.

In this chapter, the connections within the mammalian cochlear nucleus
stellate network (Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}) are developed using a
sequential method of optimisation steps.  The parameters of each cell
type are determined based on experimental data or are optimised based
solely on responses to simple stimuli.
Each cell type is typified with its characteristic \PSTH in response
to short tone bursts
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}, and
the \EIRA to tones across the frequency spectrum \citep{Evans:1992},
although this may vary within cell types.  \yellownote{Explain the
figure more thoroughly}

The stellate network model drawn in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}
describes the following cells and models:
1. The \AN model: A phenomenological auditory model provides spiking
   input to cochlear nucleus neurons across frequencies and spontaneous
   rate types of the \ANFs from an arbitrary input stimulus
   \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  The base line in Figure
   \ref{fig:microcircuit} is a simplification of auditory nerve fibres
   (ANF) from low \CF to high \CF (left to right). The model reproduces
   responses for high and low SR ANFs at 100 channels across the
   frequency range 200 Hz to 48 kHz.
2. The Golgi cell: a \GABA-ergic \VCN marginal shell unit that is
   presumed to regulate excitability in the \GCD and core \VCN units
   \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Only one /in vivo/ study has
   recorded extracellular data in the marginal shell area of the \CN
   \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The presumed characteristics of Golgi cells
   are taken from that study and are defined by a monotonic response to
   tones and noise, a type I\slash III \EIRA, and an unusual or chopper
   \PSTH.
3. The D stellate cell: a glycinergic, large multipolar cell with \OnC
   \PSTH response that acts as a coincidence detector.  Its large
   dendritic area increases its response to noise allowing it to behave
   as a wide-band inhibitor in the \VCN, \DCN, and contralateral \CN
   \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
4. The Tuberculoventral cell: a glycinergic, type II \EIRA unit in the
   deep layer of the \DCN \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  This cell acts
   as a delayed echo-suppressor and narrow-band inhibitor, with
   recurrent connections between D and T stellate cells in the \VCN
   \citep{Alibardi:2006,OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991}.
5. The T stellate cell: one of the major output projection cells of the
   cochlear nucleus to the inferior colliculus.  This multipolar neuron
   has been shown to have robust spectral representation and enhanced
   synchronisation to modulation in speech sounds
   \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

Optimisation of a detailed \BNN model requires a realistic input model
with which to mimick the behaviour experimentally observed in live
neural networks. The input to the CN stellate model, the auditory nerve
fibres, is discussed in the next section. To further fit the parameters
of the CN model, a simplistic and sequential method is applied to each
of the cell-types using experimental data.

\yellownote{This para is about pushing the reader towards the following
  sections.  I'm not sure about the assertion of 'well-tested': too
  narrative, less science-y.  Needs to expand on reasons for wanting to
  create a biophysically realistic model of the CN. Discuss reason for
  using whole network in TV and TS optimisation. }


# \yellownote{Auditory model and history should be in the METHODS section.}

# A paragraph on the history of AN modelling \citep{LeakeSnyderEtAl:1993,
# ArnesenOsen:1978, CloptonWinfieldEtAl:1974}.  Perhaps Rose et al 1959 would be
# better suited here}

In examining the properties of a detailed neural model of the cochlear
nucleus, a realistic and phenomenologically sound auditory model is
needed to represent sounds and transformations that occur in the
central auditory system.


* Methods

** Auditory Nerve Fibre Model 
\yellownote{This may need to go in Methods chapter}

The auditory nerve inputs to the cochlear nucleus model neurons are
provided by phenomenological auditory periphery models originating
from \citet{Carney:1993}, the ARLO model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001},
the Bruce model \citep{BruceSachsEtAl:2003, ZilanyBruce:2006,
ZilanyBruce:2007}, and the Zilany model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.
The auditory model consists of an outer\slash middle ear
pre-processing filter, a cochlea filterbank, IHC-to-AN synapse model
and dead-time modified Poisson spike generator, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:ZilanyBruceFig}.  \citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated
cochlea filters based on the critical bandwidths obtained from
psychophysical experiments in humans.  The ARLO model of the cat
auditory periphery, with non-linear compression and two-tone
suppression, is used in this study except in the vowel simulation
where the human auditory periphery model is used.  

\yellownote{TODO:
AN model paragraph has been changed - fix any comment related to new
Zilany}

# The \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007} model improves the previous AN model by
# an additional signal path and its predictions have matched a wide
# range of physiological data in normal and impaired cat data. The
# most recent AN model comprises an power-law synapse model, with
# internal $1/f$ noise, that enhances the behaviour of long-term
# dependence in ANFs \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.

\yellownote{Why is it the cat model? updating Carney model? Updating
  of the Carney auditory model has led to the change in the model's
  configuration from an original implementation of the rat model.  The
  default species is the cat and will be used in the data presented in
  this chapter.}

** Spiking in Poisson Neural Models 

The neural models used in the auditory nerve fibres and Golgi cell
model are inhomogeneous Poisson processes.  The instantaneous rate is
passed through the Jackson spiking model
\citep{Jackson:2003,JacksonCarney:2005}, which includes refractory
effects typical of the auditory nerve fibres.  Spike trains for each
neuron in the model are created at the start of each repetition of the
stimulus, but can be saved and loaded from file.

# \yellownote{TODO: serious reworking to be done here}

# Analysis of the frequency
# response area of ANF generates known parameters for each fibre, these are:
# \begin{itemize}
# \item the spontaneous rate (SR), generated in silence and is
#   categoried into two groups High SR (\gt 18 sp/s) and Low SR (\lt 18
#   sp/s);
# \item threshold, the sound pressure level(SPL) at which the cell
#   responds above the spontaneous rate
# \item characteristic frequency (CF)
# \end{itemize}

** Neural Models

Single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-like neural models were used for the
neural models.  The current models in each of the cell types of the
cochlear nucleus stellate network were originally presented by
\citet{RothmanManis:2003b}.

Type I-c classic regular firing type contains a voltage-activated
sodium, high threshold potassium, and hyperpolarisation mixed-cation,
and leak current channels.  This neural model an integrator and is
strongly influenced by the \Ih current, which is active at rest.  Type
I-t transient regular firing type is similar to the Type 1 classic but
with A-type potassium current channels.  A-type potassium channels are
unique to the cochlear nucleus, particularly to T stellate cells
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}.  \DS cells contain
low-threshold potassium current channels, which is strongest in bushy
cells, to enhance response to coincident inputs.

\yellownote{Discuss RM model (put in Methods Chapter).  Perhaps expand
  more on the role of the currents on each neuron in the CN model.}

** Connectivity and Network Parameters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :LABEL: sec:Ch3:ConnectivityNetworkParameters
   :END:

Tonotopic connectivity in the stellate cochlear nucleus model is
defined by the regular organisation of afferent ANFs into distinct
iso-frequency channels.  The channels are separated using even spatial
distance (based on the basilar membrane and auditory nerve separation)
with centre frequency calculated by the Greenwood function for the cat
\citep[see~Chapter~\ref{sec:Methods},][]{Greenwood:1990}.  The HSR
terminals of individual fibres generally cover 70 \um and LSR fibres
100 \um in mice \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988,OertelWu:1989}. 
\yellownote{put greenwood function in Methods}

Figure \ref{fig:CNconn} shows the method for Gaussian spread of
connections between cell types in the \CN.  The \CF of the CN channels
are separated using the same Greenwood function as used for the
filterbank of AN frequency channels.

# * Simulations
# Optimisation simulations were designed to be performed on
# either a single PC or a parallel architecture system.
# The random number generator used was the internal RNG of NEURON, MCellRand4
# The simulation for each optimisation routine the integration timestep was either 0.05 or 0.1 ms.    parameters

\yellownote{A generic section called 'Simulations' was proposed to go
  here.  This would state the integration timestep, the system used,
  the RNG used etc.  This could perhaps go in the Methods chapter}

** Synapse Models
 
\yellownote{TODO. This is inlcuded in the GA chapter, but it should go
in the Methods chapter}

** Synaptic Delays

Mean first spike latency to short \CF tones and click stimuli were used
to set delay times between \ANFs and \CN cells
\citep{EagerGraydenEtAl:2006}.  The delay was defined using the first
spike latency of high frequency units as the sum of the \ANFs' first
spike latency, \ANF conduction delay, and the synaptic transmission
delay.  The first spike latency measured in high \CF units in the ARLO
\AN model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} for \HSR fibers was 1.5 ms.  The
additional delay from the \ANF to each cell type was calculated to be
\TS 1.6ms \citep{RhodeSmith:1986}, \DS 1.2 ms
\citep{RhodeOertelEtAl:1983}, \TV 2.0 ms \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999},
and Golgi 2.3 ms \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} to ensure the first
spike latency matched the experimental data.

#  \end{figure}

** Simulation and Parallel Capabilities

The time step of the numerical integration performed in each of the simulations in the chapter was 0.05 ms.
the parallel capabilities is based on the NEURON
network model [[latex:progname][netmod]] \citet{MiglioreCanniaEtAl:2006}
 (see SenseLab's ModelDB models
[[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=52034][52034]], [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=2730][2730]], and [[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=51781][51781]]).

** Optimisation 

\yellownote{ TODO  }

The optimisation routine
used in this chapter was NEURON's [[latex:progname][fit\_praxis]] function,  which uses the algorithm PRAXIS
\citep{Brent:1976}. The praxis returns the minimum of the function,
\texfsf{fun}, of n variables using the principal axis method without the use of
\textsf{fun}'s gradient.



** Verification of Cell Model Responses to Simple Tones and Noise

Verification of the optimisation processes requires running a suite of
tests across the whole network.  This section aims to show the
behaviour of the entire CN stellate microcircuit using parameters
obtained from the previous sections.

The stimuli presented to the stellate microcircuit included:
1. Rate-level response to pure tones at the characteristic frequency
   of the centre channel of the network, 5.81 kHz. The sound level was
   varied from 0 to 90 dB SPL.
2. Rate-level response to white noise at levels 0 to 100 dB SPL.
3. Masked rate-level response with pure tones varied in level from 0
   to 100 dB SPL and simultaneous withe noise at 50 dB SPL.

** Background

# GLG Cell Model
*** Morphology of Golgi Cells

Golgi cells are distinguished from the numerous smaller granule cells
by larger cell body and surrounding plexus of dendritic and axonal
neurites. The soma diameter of Golgi cells is approximately 15 \um
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, where the diameter of granule cells
is 8 \um in cats \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980} and 6 \um in rats and
mice \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,Alibardi:2003}.  Smooth, tapering
dendrites, between 50 and 100 \um long, emanated in all directions
(mice: \citealt{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, see also
\citealt{Cant:1993,MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}).  A dense, axonal plexus,
limited to the plane of the granule cell domain, extend about 250 \um
from the soma in all directions
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,BensonBrown:2004}.

# In layer 2 of the DCN Alibardi rat (9–15 \um) GABA-ergic cells round cell body
# surrounded by small granule cells immuno-negative to Glycine and GABA.

The dendrites of \VCN Golgi cells are mitochondria-rich and make
glomeruli complexes with long synaptic junctions with the mossy fibre
boutons \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}. The somata generally have few
boutons of flat or pleomorphic vesicle type, characteristic of
glycinergic and GABAergic terminals. Along with inhibitory boutons,
the dendrites also receive excitatory input with large (type I \ANF)
and small (type II \ANF and granule cell) vesicles
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Ryugo:2008}.

#  \citep{Alibardi:2003} In non-tonotopic circuits integration between acoustic
# and non-acoustic inputs occurs \citep{RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993}.

# The contribution of the circuits of granule cell areas of the cochlear nuclear
# complex to the processing of the acoustic signal is poorly understood (Kane,
# 1974, 1977; Mugnaini et al. 1980; 1984, 1997; Hutson and Morest, 1996; Wedman
# et al. 1996; Morest, 1997; Hurd et al. 1999).  For a review of non-auditory
# inputs to GCD see \citealt{OhlroggeDoucetEtAl:2001}.

# # from Mugnaini This paper describes the fine structure of granule cells and
# granule-associated interneurons (termed Golgi cells) in the cochlear nuclei of
# cat, rat and mouse.  Granule cells and Golgi cells are present in defined
# regions of ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei collectively termed "cochlear
# granule cell domain'. The granule cells are small neurons with two or three
# short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with terminal
# expansions. These participate in glomerular synaptic arrays similar to those
# of the cerebellar cortex. In the glomeruli the dendrites form short type 1
# synapses with a large, centrally-located mossy bouton containing round
# synaptic vesicles and type 2 synapses with peripherally located, smaller
# boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles. The granule cell axons is thin and
# beaded and, on its way to the molecular layer of the \DCN, takes a straight
# course, which in ventral nucleus is parallel to the pial surface. Neurons of
# the second category resemble cerebellar Golgi cells and occur everywhere
# interspersed among the granule cells. They are usually larger than the granule
# cells and give rise to dendrites which may branch close to and curve around
# the cell body. The dendrites contain numerous mitochondria and are laden with
# thin appendages, giving them a hairy appearance.  Both the cell body and the
# stem dendrites participate in glomerular synaptic arrays.  Golgi cell
# glomeruli are distinguishable from the granule cell glomeruli by unique
# features of the dendritic profiles and by longer, type 1 synaptic junctions
# with the central mossy bouton.  The Golgi cell axon forms a beaded plexus
# close to the parent cell body. The synaptic vesicle population of the mossy
# boutons suggests that they are a heterogeneous group and may have multiple
# origins.  Apparently, each of the various classes participates in both granule
# and Golgi cell glomeruli.  The smaller peripheral boutons with pleomorphic
# vesicles in the two types of glomeruli may represent Golgi cell axons which
# make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell axons
# which make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell
# dendrites, on the other hand, are also contacted by small boutons en passant
# with round synaptic vesicles, which may represent granule cell axons. A
# tentative scheme of the circuitry in the cochlear granule cell domain is
# presented. The similarity with the cerebellar granule cell layer is striking.

*** Cellular Mechanisms of Golgi Cells

Intracellular recordings of Golgi cells, only one study in mice, have
shown a classic repetitively-firing response to current clamp and an
inward rectifying response to voltage clamp
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Figure \ref{fig:GolgiIV}.  Golgi
cells are classified as type I and act as simple integrators of
synaptic input \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
# Their intrinsic properties suggests Golgi cells are simple integrators.
Response to AN shocks in Golgi cells were delayed by approximately 0.7
ms relative to the core \VCN units, with minimum delay in most cells
around 1.3 ms \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

# The physiological response of Golgi cells has not been extensively studied.

Extracellular recordings from labelled Golgi cells are not available
in the literature; however, an electrophysiological study of the \GCD
(or marginal shell of the \VCN in cats) has been done by one group
\citep{Ghoshal:1997,GhoshalKim:1997,GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a}
without direct labelling of recorded units.  Any extracellular spikes
recorded in the \GCD are most likely from Golgi cells since granule
cell somata are less than 10 \um and their narrow axons are unlikely
to elicit electrical activity in the electrodes
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

# There was a substantial presence of

Strongly driven units in the AVCN shell exhibiting non-saturating
rate-level functions to pure tone, noise or both with dynamic ranges
as wide as 89 dB \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The majority of recorded
\GCD units recorded by \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} were classified as type
I\slash III or III \EIRA units, showing a monotonic increase in firing
rate with increasing sound intensity to tones and noise.  Some units
examined did show type II or type IV \EIRA properties. One unit was
classified as type II due to its poor response to noise but it did not
show a reduction of response to tones at high \SPL (typical of \DCN
type II units) \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. Two units with low \CF (< 1.5
kHz) were classified as type II \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The \PSTH of
the units included wide chopper, \OnC, and pause-build, however nearly
one third of units did not fit into the known classifications and were
called unusual \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.

The latency of acoustically driven \GCD recorded units range from 2.4
ms to over 10 ms, centred on 3.75 ms.  The acoustic latency closely
matches the minimum latency of \EPSPs to AN shocks recorded in mice
/in vitro/ preparations \citep[1.3~ms,][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
Longer latencies (>10 ms) may be due to type II \ANFs (estimated
theoretical latency about 10 ms \citep{Brown:1993}) or from
polysynaptic excitation by granule cells.

The general assumption of the functional role of Golgi cells is to

control to the principal \VCN units, primarily D and T stellate cells
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

** Implementation


The presence of GABAergic inputs to \VCN and \DCN neurons has been
verified by labeled terminals adjacent to the soma and dendrites
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,BabalianRyugoEtAl:2003}
and release from inhibition in their response areas with
ionotopopheretic application of the \GABAa antagonist, bicuculine
\citep{EvansZhao:1998,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The source of GABAergic inputs to cells in the mammalian \CN is
somewhat contentious.  Studies show that GABAergic inputs to the \CN
generally arise in the peri-olivary regions of the medulla in cats
\citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997} and birds
\citep{LachicaRubsamenEtAl:1995,YangMonsivaisEtAl:1999}.  Slice
preparations of the isolated murine \VCN show strong and immediate
sensitivity to bicuculine in T and D stellate cells from a source
within the \CN complex \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The only
known source of \GABA intrinsic to the \VCN are the Golgi cells of the
\GCD overlying the \VCN
\citep{Mugnaini:1985,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

Inputs to Golgi cells are more complicated than the inputs to core
\VCN neurons.  Golgi cells are sparse in the \GCD, surrounded by the
many, smaller excitatory granule cells, that form small en-passant
endings.  Type II \ANFs create diffuse glutamatergic release sites in
the \GCD \citep{HurdHutsonEtAl:1999,BensonBrown:2004} that may
stimulate NMDA glutamate receptors in Golgi cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

The physiological response of Golgi cells has not been extensively
studied.  Intracellular recordings of Golgi cells in one study by
\citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} have shown a classic type I current
response.  This suggests Golgi cells are simple integrators.  Their
response to auditory nerve shocks were delayed by approximately 0.7 ms
relative to the core \VCN units \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
Extracellular recordings from labelled Golgi cells is not available in
the literature; however, the \GCD (or marginal shell of the \VCN in
cats) has been studied by one group \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} without
direct labelling of recorded units.  Any extracellular spikes recorded
in the \GCD are most likely from Golgi cells since granule cell somata
are less than 10 \um and their narrow axons are unlikely to elicit
electrical activity in the electrodes.  The majority of recorded units
showed a monotonic increase in firing rate with increasing sound
intensity \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}][]{GhoshalKim:1996}.

Their monotonic responses to tones and noise over a wide dynamic range
provides regulation of activity in granule cells.  The contribution of
a delayed, negative feedback onto \VCN units is analogous to automatic
gain control provides strong evidence for regulation of activity in
granule cells. The general assumption of the functional role of Golgi
cells is to regulate granule cells but they may also provide automatic
gain control to the principal VCN units, primarily D and T stellate
cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

#+LaTeX:\include{GolgiRateLevelTable}

In the creation of the Golgi cell model, we can reduce the explicit
behaviour of Golgi cells down to four major details:
 1. Golgi cells are classic repetitively-firing neurons due to their
    type I current clamp response \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
 2. Golgi cells have a low maximum rate and large dynamic range to
    tone and noise increases, given marginal shell extracellular
    recordings of \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} could not come from granule
    cells.
 3. The low threshold in Golgi cells, \citet{GhoshalKim:1997},
    can\-not be due to \LSR auditory nerve fibres. The lack of
    extensive experimental data regarding type II \ANF units, that do
    project to the \GCD, and granule cell response to acoustic input
    meant that a Poisson rate neural model would be preferred over the
    Hodgkin-Huxley type neural model.  Although \HSR \ANF terminals do
    not generally project into the \GCD, they are included in this
    model to provide some low level sound-induced activity.
 4. The minimum \EPSP to shock of the AN
    \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} and mean first spike latency to
    acoustic stimuli \citep{GhoshalKim:1997} are significantly
    different from the core \VCN units.

The Golgi cell model is implemented as an instantaneous-rate Poisson
rate model, shown in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}D and in
Figure \ref{fig:GolgiDiagram}.  The primary inputs are from the auditory
model's instantaneous rate outputs with connections across frequency
channels.  \HSR and \LSR \ANF inputs to Golgi cells were determined the
Gaussian distribution in units of channel separation in the network.
The weighted sum of \HSR and \LSR instantaneous-rate vectors are
smoothed out by an alpha function mimicking a synaptic and dendritic
smoothing filter.  The synaptic and dendritic filter kernel, $\alpha(t)$ is
normalised by setting the area under the function to one. For a large
enough filter length, the alpha function integral ($\int \alpha(t) dt =
(-\Gtau^2 - t \cdot \Gtau)\cdot \exp(-\frac{t}{\Gtau})$) approximately equals
$\Gtau^2$. In this case $10 \times \Gtau$ is used for the filter length.

Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}A shows the model summary for
optimising the Golgi cell model.  As explained in the introduction,
the Nordlie tables are used to communicate detailed neural models and
networks for further replication by the computational neuroscience
community.  The topology of the ventral cochlear nucleus follows the
same tonotopic organisation of the auditory nerve, with 100 evenly
spaced frequency channels.  The population of \ANFs in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}B are zero because there is no need for
spiking \ANF neurons, only the instantaneous profiles of each
frequency channel is used in the Golgi model.  The connectivity
between \ANFs and Golgi cells (Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}C)
is a simple place-based Gaussian spread, as explained in the Methods Chapter
 (Section \ref{sec:Ch2:ConnectivityandTopology}
[[*Connectivity%20and%20Topology][Connectivity and Topology in Neural Microcircuits]]).

     final stage sets the spontaneous rate by addition at t=0, changes any
     negative values to zero, and includes an additional delay of 2.5 ms,

     \citet{GhoshalKim:1997}.}

The weight vectors, $\mathbf{w}_{HSR}$ and $\mathbf{w}_{LSR}$, span
the network's channels with size $N_{\textrm channel}$, with a normal

Instantaneous-rate profiles of the \AN have size $N_\textrm{channel}$
and length determined by the stimulus ($N_\textrm{stim}$ = stimulus
duration / sampling rate).  The intermediate step in the Golgi cell
model, $r(\cdot)$, corrects the output rate for the desired
spontaneous activity, \Gspon, and performs rectification on the signal
to avoid negative rate values.  The final step involves convolution
with the alpha function, $\alpha(t)$, as the synapto-dendritic
filtering mechanism in the Golgi cell.  The alpha filter length was 10
times the time constant, \Gtau, and its area under the function was
normalised to 1.  A more detailed explanation of the NEURON
implementation of the Golgi cell model is in the Appendix \label{sec:Ch3:Appendix}.

** Optimisation Results

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult} shows the output of the test
optimisation trials for the Golgi cell model.  The testing trial used
only five sound levels (0, 15, 55, 75 and 85 dB \SPL) and detected the
mean rate from the instantaneous profile in its fitting routine.  The
best response obtained a minimum root mean squared error of 11.63
spikes/sec against the five points in the target experimental data of
unit S03-07 (CF=21 kHz) from \citet{GhoshalKim:1996}.  A rate-level
curve (green circles, Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult}) was generated
from the spiking output only to show a big discrepancy in the
spike-based rate-level and the monotonic rate based rate-level.  The
lack of low level response and a higher threshold indicated the need
for some \HSR input into the Golgi cell model.

The final optimisation routine with 22 levels and a Golgi cell model
with \HSR and \LSR \ANF inputs was used to generate a closer fit to
the \citeauthor{GhoshalKim:1996} data.  Figure \ref{fig:GolgiResult}
shows the rate-level output of the best model response and its best
combination of parameters are shown in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}E.  The root mean squared error of the
best response was 4.48 spikes per second.

#+LABEL: fig:GolgiResult
[[./gfx/GolgiRateLevel_result.pdf]]

The parameters in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellResults} were within the
range of expected values.  \LSR inputs to the Golgi cell model
out-weighted \HSR inputs by more than a factor of 10.  The monotonic
response of \LSR fibres at high sound levels were necessary to create
the large dynamic range in the Golgi cell model, the \HSR fibres were
just as necessary to provide some low level activity.  The spontaneous
rate parameter matches the base response of unit S03-07 in Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiResult}.  The smoothing filter time constant of 5 ms is
a typical value in membrane time constants for neural models and fits
with the input resistance in intracellular recordings of Golgi cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

The input spread parameter is not well constrained by the optimisation
fitness routine with a pure tone input and a single neuron, but the
result is satisfactory given the uncertainty in \LSR fibre's axonal
organisation in the \GCD.  The dendritic widths in Golgi cells are
around 100 microns and the frequency separation laminae in the \VCN
core is approximately 70 \um, giving an expected result of 1.5
connectivity spread hence the result of 2.48 channels gives added
frequency spread from \LSR fibres.

inputs to determine it's behaviour outside of the optimisation
routine.  The Golgi cell model was tested across the entire network
using tones, noise and tones plus noise stimuli. Figure

cell model at the centre of the network (CF=5.8 kHz) and had monotonic
responses to tones and noise similar to other Ghoshal and Kim units

** TODO Introduction

\glsreset{DS} 


In the mammalian \CN, \DS cells have a wide ranging influence on almost all
primary cells of the \CN.  Glycinergic terminals of the \DS cell
contact \TS and bushy neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983},
and fusiform and \TV neurons in the ipsilateral \DCN
(type II and type IV \EIRA units). Some \DS cells exit the \CN,
forming the commissural connection with the contralateral \CN
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007}.  In vitro studies have shown that \DS
cells are strongly regulated by the neurotransmitter GABA
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  Golgi cells are the only
GABAergic neuron in the VCN, but their axonal plexus does not extend
into the magnocellular core.  \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997} found that all
DS cells labelled from BDA injections in the DCN had dendritic
projections that entered the GCD, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:DSinGCD}.

#+CAPTION: (Left) TS cells that were retrogradely labeled from injections in the DCN lie in the narrow frequency band corresponding to presumed frequency band of the injection site in the DCN. Labeled DS cells were spread over the nucleus. (Right) All DS cells, labeled by \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997}, had dendritic processes extending into the granule cell domain. Large multipolar VCN neurons, DS cells, are known to have dendritic projections into the GCD, the location of GABAergic Golgi cells.   Images reproduced from figure 3C in \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997}.

*** Morphology and Cellular Mechanisms of D Stellate Cells

\todo[inline]{This section to be completed}

\DS cells are large multipolar neurons in the \VCN and have an \OnC
\PSTH to tones and noise \citep{SmithRhode:1989,NeedhamPaolini:2006}.
They typically have 3--4 long dendrites stretching 200 microns (or one
third of the \VCN) and their axonal collaterals cover the same region
in the \VCN, almost one half of the \DCN, and are one source of the
commissural projection to the contralateral cochlear nucleus
\citep{Cant:1992,Cant:1981,SchofieldCant:1996,CantBenson:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2007,PaoliniClark:1999}.
Intracellular responses to sounds indicate the bandwidth of inputs to
\DS neurons typically ranges from two octaves below \CF to one octave
above \CF
\citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PaoliniClark:1999}.
\DS cell axon terminals contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter
glycine and synapse widely in the \VCN and \DCN\.  They also send a
commissural projection to the contralateral cochlear nucleus that
mediates fast inhibition between the nuclei
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2006,Oertel:1997}.

*** Acoustic Properties of D Stellate Cells

Intracellular responses to sounds indicate that the bandwidth of
inputs to \DS neurons is typically two octaves below \CF and one
octave above \CF
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.

Post-onset GABAergic inhibition in \DS cells is a major influence on
the \PSTH of \OnC neurons
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a,EvansZhao:1998}.  Latency of
excitation to auditory nerve shocks suggests Golgi cells are activated
by type II \ANFs and low spontaneous rate type I \ANFs
\citep{BensonBerglundEtAl:1996,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Therefore,
type II and \LSR type I \ANFs could be involved in gain control
through GABAergic modulation of activity in the \VCN.

# 2.5. Data analysis Data were collected as spike times with a
# resolution of 10 μs and analyzed off-line on a micro-VAX 3100
# (Digital). Response histograms were plotted and analyzed using a
# windowing technique in which spike counts were taken over brief time
# windows of identical duration for the masker and probe components
# (Fig. 1B). Using the control conditions, counting windows were
# determined individually for each unit but ranged between 1 and 4 ms
# based on the control response to the masker alone and the probe
# alone. To assess response variability over time, repeated unmasked
# controls for both the masker (masker alone, Ma) and probe (probe
# alone, Pa) were obtained during the pre-drug, drug, and post-drug
# recovery conditions. Drug doses were determined empirically as the
# lowest dose that elicited a reproducible and reversible effect. To
# allow normalization of the masked probe response obtained in the
# paired-click paradigm to the unmasked response obtained when the probe
# was presented alone, identical measurement windows were used in the
# control and drug conditions for a given unit. The suppression recovery
# functions for each unit were normalized by taking the ratio Pm/Pa
# where Pm is the masked probe spike count and Pa is the unmasked
# response to the probe (Fig. 1C).


In order to specify how ANF and GABA-ergic inputs regulate the click recovery response
in DS cells, a parameter optimisation routine was performed.  
The \DS neural model was implemented with a single-compartment, type
I-II Rothman and Manis model \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The type I-II
Rothman and Manis is unique to \DS cells due to the small presence of
low-threshold potassium currents.  A larger cell body diameter, average
25 \um \citep{SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, was included in
the model and conductance parameters were adjusted accordingly to keep
total-compartment conductance the same as the original values
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.


Key elements in the creation of the D stellate cell model are shown in
the Nordlie Table \ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}A.  A type I-II single
compartment neuron by \citet{RothmanManis:2003b} has the
characteristics of a onset chopper unit and has previously been used
to simulate a \DS cell model.  The choice of having a large multipolar
neuron without dendrites was based on computational efficiency and
ensuring that the model fit within the criteria for DS cells.  The
electrotonic dendrites of \DS cells mean that the filtering in \DS
cells primarily controls the height of excitatory \PSPs reaching the
soma \citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994}; hence, a single compartment with
graded weights should suffice.

#+LaTeX:\include{DSRecoveryTable}

\DS input parameters that were preemptively fixed included the number of \GLG to
\DS synapses ($\nGLGDS = 25$), the spread of \ANFs to \DS cells
(\sANFDSh and \sANFDSl), and the conduction delay from the auditory
nerve (\dANFDS).  The first spike latency in high \CF \DS cells ($2.8 \pm 0.09$ ms) is
precise and faster than other stellate neurons in the VCN
\citep{RhodeSmith:1986}.  The addition of 0.5 ms to \ANF to \DS input
connections is a combination of conductance and synaptic delay.  

The synaptic connections onto the D stellate cell model, shown in Table
\ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}C, are simplified to afferent ANF inputs and
intra-nuclear co-localised GABAergic input from Golgi cells.  The \ANF
spread onto \DS cells is well documented
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the nucleus
\citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and in physiological studies the
response area of \DS cell was approximately 1 octave above \CF and 2
octaves below the \CF \citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
Due to the large computational task of calculating an optimisation
routine for \DS input bandwidth across the whole network, the spread of
\ANF to \DS cells was split into a Gaussian distribution with spread
below (\sANFDSl=5) and spread above \CF , assuming average octave
separation between channels is 0.4 octaves, approximate the calculated
response area \citep{PaoliniClark:1999}.  The offset of \ANF to \DS
cells is zero.

The physiological effect of GABAergic inputs onto onset choppers is
primarily on \CF
\citep{CasparyHaveyEtAl:1979,PalombiCaspary:1992,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,CasparyPalombi:1993,CasparyPalombiEtAl:1993},
but the bandwidth is difficult to ascertain.  Widely spread dendrites of
\DS cells occasionally project into the \GCD
\citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}. \yellownote{fix
this} Golgi cells' axonal collaterals are confined to 200 microns in the
\GCD and \ANF tonotopic organisation in the \GCD is less defined.  The
spread of \GLG cells onto \DS cells is set to 2 channels with zero
offset, which corresponds to a \DS cell selecting from approximately 5
nearest Golgi cells.

The \DS model was tested with six pairs of mask/recovery click pairs,
with intervals 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16 ms (as per the intervals used by
\citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997} and the responses in shown in Figure
\ref{fig:BackoffPalombi}.  PSTHs of the spiking output of \DS units were
generated from 25 stimulus repetitions. Each response to a click is
measured for a period of 2 ms.  The sample period was delayed by 4 ms,
an estimate of the auditory delay and minimum first spike latency for
the DS unit.  The unit used in the optimisation has a CF = 5.8 kHz
(channel no. 50).   Spontaneous activity  in idle periods were used for additional weighted penalties 
measures of spontaneous activity and restrict over excitation by ANFs.

** INPROGRESS Optimisation Results

Optimisation parameters for \GLGDS are optimised based on experimental
click recovery data from \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:BackoffPalombi}.  The input stimulus presented a series
of masker-probe clicks, with intervals of 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16 ms,
separated by 50 ms.  Although the experimental stimuli was presented
every 250 ms, the optimisation stimulus needs to be computationally
efficient so the separation was shortened and the sequence reordered to
obtain the best click recovery response in the \DS and Golgi cells.  The
stimulus was repeated 25 times and a PSTH was produced from the DS
cells' spikes.  Spike counts for 2 ms after the probe and masker click
were selected (accounting for the the minimum first spike latency for
the unit) to calculate a recovery ratio.  The \DS cell optimisation
function calculates the mean squared error between the test model and
the experimental data recovery ratios to 5 click pairs.

The six parameters to be fit by the routine are the weights of \GLG,
\HSR, and \LSR synapses on \DS, the \GABAa synapse rise constant, the
\GABAa synapse decay constant, and the \DS cell maximum leak conductance
(\gleak).  Initial optimisation procedures were not successful at
constraining the short delay recovery responses (2,3,4 ms), hence the
\DS cell's \Ileak and \IKLT conductance parameters were included in the
optimised parameters to allow cell's input resistance behaviour to fit
fast acting behaviour in the cell.
The unit used in the optimisation has a \CF of 5.8 kHz (equivalent to
channel no. 50 in the CN network with 100 channels from 0.2 to 30
kHz).

Figures \ref{fig:DSClickRecoveryResult} shows the results of the final
parameters in the \DS click recovery optimisation routine.  The
optimisation parameters show a clear favouritism toward the \LSR input
rather than the \HSR input to \DS units.  While this may not seem ideal
for fast coincidence detection, the large number of \HSR synapses makes
up for the small weight that was obtained in the optimisation.

The optimised parameters for inputs to the D stellate cell model were
applied to \DS units across the whole network using tones, noise and
tones plus noise stimuli.  The \DS model outputs' behaviour is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}, similar to the Golgi cell model Figure
\ref{fig:Golgiverification}.  Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}A and B
show the response of the central \DS model (CF=5.8 kHz). The onset PSTH
monotonic responses to tones and noise similar to other Ghoshal and Kim
units (Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}).  Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}C
shows the wide response of all \DS units in the network to a 5.8 kHz
tone for increasing sound level.  Adding masking noise increases the
width of the activity across the CF of the central unit (Figure
\ref{fig:DSverification}D) highlighting the broad inputs of \ANFs onto
\DS units.

* Tuberculoventral Cell Model: Optimisation Using Tone and Noise Rate Level Responses 


\TV cells are characterized as having a non-monotonic response to
tones with increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband
noise \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005},
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1}.

** INPROGRESS Background

# Alibardi:2003 In layer 3 of the DCN, glycinergic vertical neurons are present,
# and they have specific nuclear and synaptic characteristics that distinguish
# them from Golgi-stellate cells present in the same layer (Saint-Marie et
# al. 1991; Wickesber & Oertel, 1993; Alibardi, 1999b, 2000a). Vertical (or
# tuberculo-ventral) neurons form a local circuit that connects the dorsal to
# the ventral cochlear nuclei, and also contact the basal dendrites of pyramidal
# cells (Saint-Marie et al. 1991, 1993; Wickesberg & Oertel, 1993; Ferragamo et
# al. 1998).


# Tuberculoventral neurons in the deep layer of the \DCN provide a delayed,
# frequency-specific glycinergic inhibition to TS and DS cells in the \VCN
# \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1988}.  The dendrites of TV cells are
# aligned with \ANFs and indicating narrow frequency tuning. TV cells have low
# spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs; “pauser,” “chopper,” or
# “onset/sustained” have been recorded
# \citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
# response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are
# non-monotonic functions of intensity.

# Anterograde labelling in the \DCN suggests glycinergic Tuberculoventral cells
# project tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-\CF, but also to the adjacent
# low and high frequency side bands in the \AVCN
# \citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004}.  Ultra-structural
# labelling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggest \TV cells are inhibited by DS
# cells and from sources in the \DCN but excitatory inputs were not found from
# TS cells \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.  Intracellular responses from labeled TV
# cells in the mouse show clear excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse
# inhibitory input from DS cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.

\TV or vertical cells are glycinergic, inhibitory cells found in the
deep layers of the \DCN that send axon collaterals to the \VCN.  They
are characterized as having a non-monotonic response to tones with
increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}, as shown
in Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1}.  Anterograde labeling in the \DCN
suggests \TV cells project tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-CF, but
also to the low and high frequency side bands
\citep{MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.  With
retrograde labelling in the \DCN three types of ventro-tubercular units
in rats were identified \citet{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}, as
apposed to only two types in cats
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.  These units are identified
as \TS and \DS cells, with the third in rats identified as small
adendritic neurons.

Ultra-structural labeling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggest \TV cells
are inhibited by glycinergic \DS cells and from sources in the \DCN but
excitatory inputs were not found from \TS cells in the rat
\citep{Rubio:2005}.  Evidence in the mouse suggests otherwise since
intracellular responses from labeled \TV cells in the mouse show clear
excitatory input from \TS cells and diffuse inhibitory input from \DS
cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1993}.

# \TV cells receive mono-synaptic excitatory input from auditory nerve fibres
# \citep{OertelWu:1989,ZhangOertel:1993b}.

*** Acoustic Response of Tuberculoventral cells

\TV cells have low spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs (pause-build,
unusual chopper, or onset with sustained activity) have been recorded
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are
non-monotonic functions of intensity.

# Responses of tuberculoventral neurons to sound
Recordings \textit{in vivo} indicate that tuberculoventral cells
probably have type II characteristics and respond with “chopper”
temporal response patterns \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}. Units with type
II responses are sharply tuned, they have thresholds - 10 dB higher
than other units with which they are intermingled, and they do not
respond to broad-band noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungBrownell:1976,Young:1980,SachsYoung:1980,YoungVoigt:1982,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1990,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,Rhode:1999}. Young
and his colleagues have shown that most neurons in the deep DCN
respond to sound with either of two major types of response maps, type
II or type IV
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1980,VoigtYoung:1990,Young:1980,YoungBrownell:1976}.

Taken together with EM studies, the results suggest that auditory nerve
fibres (predominantly \LSR fibres) form the major excitatory input to
type II DCN units along with other excitation from TS cells.  If true,
this hypothesis could also explain the finding that type II DCN units
have consistently higher thresholds than \DCN principal cells
\citep{YoungBrownell:1976} because \LSR auditory nerve fibres auditory
nerve fibres \citep{Liberman:1978}.  However, patterns of also have
elevated thresholds relative to the lowest threshold auditory nerve
innervation of the \DCN are most consistent with \HSR fibre innervation
of \TV cell somata and \LSR fibre innervation of dendrites
\citep{Liberman:1993}.  In that case, the low spontaneous rates and high
sound thresholds of type II DCN units might be caused by a high
intrinsic electrical threshold \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}; this is
consistent with the responses of vertical cells to intracellular current
injection \citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.

Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the \VCN
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but the role of type II terminals in the
\VCN is less clear.  Three different hypotheses have been raised.  The
first is that this projection modulates the response thresholds of \VCN
neurons \citep{PaoliniClark:1998}.  The role of type II units in
spectral processing is that of a narrowband inhibitor. Responses of \DCN
principal cells are strongly inhibited by this narrowband source.  As a
result, \DCN principal cells are inhibited by sharp spectral peaks close
to their \BF \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.

** TODO Modelling of Tuberculoventral cells

- Expand previous studies of the DCN incl. TV cells
- \citet{ArleKim:1991a} were the first to show type II \EIRA with
  simple McCullock-Pitts point neuron models.
- (From Hancock Davis Voigt 97) Blum et al. (1995) used a wideband
  inhibitory mechanism to create type II unit responses in a model of
  the DCN\. In that model, each cell population was described by a
  mathematical formula for its steady-state rate-level function. This
  level of abstraction was used to focus specifically on the role of
  network connectivity in determining the steady-state behavior of
  DCNunits. The level of abstraction employed in our model allows for
  examination of temporal response properties including PST histograms
  and cross-correlation analysis.
- \citep{DunnVetterEtAl:1996} performed some modelling.

Modelling of Type II units in the \DCN has been thoroughly categorised by
Davis and colleagues
\citep{YoungDavis:2002,HancockDavisEtAl:2001,DavisYoung:2000,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,DavisVoigt:1996,DavisVoigt:1994,DavisVoigt:1991}.
Low spontaneous rate is created in a neural model by either increasing
the intrinsic spiking threshold or lowering the synaptic strength of the
inputs.  Intracellular observations in decerebrate gerbils show higher
thresholds in type II units \citep{DingVoigt:1997}; and intracellularly
recorded type II units.  Another case for type II behaviour of no
spontaneous activity, is a preference of \LSR, high observations of
hyperpolarisation responses to off \gls{BF} tones in threshold \AN
fibres over \HSR fibres to synapse with \TV cells.  Whether \LSR fibres
preference the deep layers of the \CN are yet to be confirmed
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

- \citep{Rhode:1999} Vertical cells in gerbils (mainly type III)

The intrinsic mechanism is more favourable in Type II units, provided
there is sufficient inhibition and excitation
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}.  Lateral inhibition was disregarded in
favour of wide-band inhibition \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997} and is
favoured in this model.  Work by Reed and Blum
\citep{ReedBlum:1995,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReed:1998} on
the circuitry of the \DCN showed that wide-band inhibition was necessary
for the principal cells of the \DCN including type II units.

* D Stellate to Tuberculoventral Cell Connection: Optimisation of Asymmetry in Wide-band Inhibition to TV Cells Using Notch Noise Responses 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :LABEL: sec:Ch3:DSTV
  :END:
** TODO Background

The increase in rate of TV cells in regions below the frequency of the
notch is the main argument for the assertion of offset in DS to TV
cell connections.\yellownote{MTD think about combining this section with TV model optimisation}

#+LaTeX: \include{TV_NotchTable}

** INPROGRESS Implementation

Table \ref{tab:TVNotchModelSummary} shows the implementation parameters for the optimisation of \DS cell connections to \TV cells.

The experimental data by \citet{ReissYoung:2005} was recorded from adult
cats, with the notch noise produced in the frequency domain (accounting
for calibration of the ear canal speaker spectrum) and sampled with
fixed random phases in the time domain.  The notch sweep sets used by
\citeauthor{ReissYoung:2005} were generated with logarithmically
constant notch widths and notch center frequencies ranging from 1 octave
below to 1 octave above \BF in $1/50$ octave steps.  The notch noise
presented in this optimisation routine was generated in
[[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using frozen Gaussian noise
(100kHz sampling rate) and a Chebyshev type II band reject filter[fn::
The \textsf{[[latex:progname][cheby2}]] function is in the octave-forge signal package and
MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox.].  The sound level in the
\citet{ReissYoung:2005} data further complicates the situation.  The
power spectrum is maintained at a constant level per frequency band (dB
per Hz$^{1/2}$) and this is processed and scaled at each point in the notch
sweep.  For a single presentation used in this experiment the sound
level plays an important part in stimulating the \ANFs and contributing
interneurons.  The experimental data shown in Figure
\ref{fig:TVReissFig9}, show the mean response to notch sweeps at 22
dB/Hz$^{1/2}$.

The experimental data, shown in Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9}, is the
average responses of type II \DCN units to notch sweeps.  The
optimisation routine would be prohibitive if it was a notch sweep
simulated on a single neuron; therefore, this optimisation uses a single
notch presentation across an entire network of TV cells.  Accordingly,
the fitness function must take into account the relative position of
cells in the network when comparing the experimental data.  For example,
when presented with a notch noise filtered between 5kHz and 10kHz, a
unit with \CF of 5kHz will see a falling edge of a 1 octave notch,
whereas a unit with \CF of 10kHz, will see a rising edge of a half
octave notch.  Figure \ref{fig:TVNotchDiagram} shows the combination of
the type \DCN II unit notch data for 1 octave.

Higher thresholds in type II \DCN units \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} and
the presence of multiple inhibitory synapses \citep{Alibardi:2006}
suggest \TV cells either receive a strong inhibitory influence or they
have a lower \RMP due to a lower leak current reversal potential. A
reduced resting membrane potential may increase the threshold for
excitatory inputs to generate action potentials.

# \yellownote{I allowed HSR2TV weight value go negative to give a constant
# inhibitory input. Then on 2 other runs I shifted the reversal potential of the
# leak current to $-70$ and $-75$.}

The big issue with the optimisation of population mean rate responses is
that the model could be over simplified and remove timing information.
The \HSR rate response is generally flat at medium to high sound
intensities.  \DS cell response has a regular onset spike but has a low
rate throughout the stimulus, which detracts from the purpose of using a
whole network to optimise parameters for synaptic inputs regarding \TV
cells.  The \TV rate response could therefore just be modeled on the
\LSR response using a simple gradient-decent method.

\yellownote{Population mean rate: Pros: fairly stable for smallish
repetitions, Cons: removes timing}

Complicated issues in \TV model optimisation:
- Input model: reverting back to original Zilany model (2006-2007)
- Golgi model: from previous tests
- \DS model: from previous tests.  Sustained portion does not fire
  enough even at high notch level (SPL=90).  \TV response heavily
  dependant on \DS input.
- \TV model: Difficult to reconstruct model by changing number or
  offset during optimisation.
- \TV model: \DS2TV connections are STILL randomly selected given
  number, spread and offset
  - connections can be fixed by using mean and Pd, but this discrete
    method can be crude
- Experimental data: rate vs notch position is relative to \BF of unit
- Experimental data: sound level dependant on \BF and notch position,
  this means that the relative spectrum level may be variable along
  the network

# By setting the reversal potential of \TV cells to $-75$ mV, the optimisation
# produced the following results in Figure \ref{fig:TVresultErev75}. In this
# figure, the \TV rate-place profile gains no benefit from the reduced reversal
# potential.  Some contributing factors that may explain the poor optimisation
# performance are the low firing of \DS cells and the notch stimulus sound level
# remained at 90 dB \SPL.

connections a new error function was created to delete all synapses then
reconnect the network with the new parameters.  Figure

input sound intensities.  The performance improves when reducing the

The first set of parameters (\nDSTV, \wDSTV, \nLSRTV, \nHSRTV, \wLSRTV,
\wHSRTV) were run three times to strengthen the validity of the
optimisation results.  The obvious outcome from this sets results are
the dominance of \LSR fibre excitatory inputs over \HSR fibres; and the
large counter-balance of \DS cell inhibition on \TV cells.  The second
set of parameters (\sDSTV, \Eleak \oDSTV, \nDSTV, \wDSTV) were run for
an additional three runs to stabilise the \DSTV parameters.  \nDSTV and
\wDSTV were included in both sets and showed a large decrease due to the
effect of the \TV cell's leak reversal potential \Eleak scaling down to
-75 mV.

The eventual result of the offset parameter ($\oDSTV = 22.03$) was
unexpected.  The offset is equivalent in octaves of 2.5 octaves at the
lowest channel to 1.45 at the highest channel.  \citet{ReissYoung:2005}
predicted the offset to be 0.3 octaves, which would be between 2 to 4
channels depending on the location in the network.  This is most likely
caused by a local minimum in the optimisation and noise in the model
prevented the routine from finding lower scores.

Another optimisation run at 70 dB \SPL produced a better result for the
offset parameter and the overall error value of the fitness function.
The offset of \DS onto \TV cells was more desirable at 2.1 channels,
equivalent to a mean of 0.14 octaves (0.34 octaves at the lowest channel
and 0.13 at the highest channel).  The results in the first set
(Optimisation A) show the dominance of \LSR over \HSR fibres in the
number of synapses (29 to 1) and the increased need for \DS cell
inhibition with a high \nDSTV.

** TODO Verification of connectivity between DS and TV cells

The response of individual type II units to notch and band-pass sweeps
in Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9} (reprinted from Figure 9 in
\citep*{ReissYoung:2005}) was the main target for the optimisation of
\TV cells.  To replicate the response of a single unit to notch sweeps,
notches were generated in [[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using Chebychev II filters
with a sampling rate of 100 kHz and an optimal filter number.  The half
octave sweep was calculated from -2 to 2 octaves away from 12.7 kHz at
1/32$^{nd}$ increments with logarithmically constant notch widths. A 50 ms
stimulus at 50 dB SPL was setup up in the \AN model for use by the \CN
stellate model[fn:: Logarithmically constant means the notch width is
calculated at the centre frequency of the notch and not the \CF of the
unit of interest.].  Figure \ref{fig:TVSweepUnit70} shows the response

* TODO T Stellate Cell Model: Optimisation of Three Chopper Subtypes Using CF Tones 

Accurate modelling of the cochlear nucleus, in particular chopper
units and T stellate cells.

** TODO Background

\yellownote{Expand background}

A considerable amount of literature has been published on the T stellate
cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus.  The first extracellular
physiology studies classified supposed \TS cells into regular-firing
choppers \citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1966}.  With further developments in
analysis and classification techniques, \TS cells were segregated into
slowly or transiently adapting and sustained chopper sub-types
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  In cats,
\citet{SmithRhode:1989} was the first to do simultaneous labelling of
\TS cells and confirmed the physiological response of type I multipolar
neurons into choppers.  This simultaneous classification and labelling
was followed by others in gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}, guinea pigs
\citep{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and rats
\citep{PaoliniClarkEtAl:1997,PaoliniClark:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}. In
each of the studies, there was no morphological properties that
segregated transient and sustained choppers, which indicate synaptic
inputs play a strong role in output of \TS cells.

Averaging intracellular responses to acoustic input to determine
stochastic excitatory\slash inhibitory inputs was first used in the
chopper units of gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}.
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005} used similar averaging of \TS and DS cell
intracellular responses in rats as the basis for a thorough statistical
analysis to separate chopper units into three distinct subtypes.  Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} shows the intracellular acoustic classification of
chopper units in the rat into three distinct types
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}: ChS chopper sustained, and two transient
choppers, ChT1 and ChT2.  The intracellular traces in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} along with the CV statistics Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata} will form the basis for the optimisation routine
of the \TS cell model of each chopper type.

The categorisation via coefficient of variation is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata}.  Sustained choppers maintain a stable CV below
0.2 throughout the entire stimulus. The transient chopper optimisation
had two types defined by \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The first CT
type is categorised with CV starting below 0.2 then rising, hence the
name transient, but stays below 0.3.  The second CT type is regular in
the first 10 ms period, but rises to 0.3 or above throughout the
stimulus.

calculated the mean squared error between a combination of the
intracellular and spikes statistics against the experimental data by
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.

Coefficient of variation of the inter-spike intervals was calculated
over 10 ms windows.  Spike trains without the first three regular
spikes were ignored.

** Optimisation Results

\yellownote{Choosing optimisation data - average population data or
individual exemplar based on Paolini rat data.}

What is not shown in Figure \ref{fig:TSinputs} the non-linear dynamics
of the action potential in the neural model. The hyperpolarisation
activation of \Ih and \IKA currents due to inhibitory input are not
evident.  The second factor is important in enhancing the first spike
response across the T stellate cells \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004} to
an oncoming stimulus, since the \OnC units will respond earlier and
provide fast inhibition.

#  \includegraphics{RateLevel/TS_ratelevel}} \end{figure}

The final error for the optimisation routine was calculated as the
square root of the mean squared error between the first 4 CV periods
and the three voltage measures.  The measures of membrane voltage were
independent of \RMP included a) the onset ratio
(Eq. \ref{eq:IVstats-Onset}), b) adaptation of sustained
depolarisation (Eq. \ref{eq:IVstats-Adap}), and c) post-tone
hyperpolarisation (Eq. \ref{eq:IVstats-Offset}).

*** Sustained Chopper

\glsreset{ChS} Figure \ref{fig:CSresults} shows the optimisation
results for the \ChS unit 01-864-004 from
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}, with \CF 3.9 kHz.  This unit had a
depolarisation threshold at 10 dB and a firing rate saturation at 75
dB \SPL.  The stimulus for the optimisation routine was a pure tone 30
dB above depolarisation threshold at \CF (3.9 kHz 40 dB \SPL), 5 ms
on\slash off cosine squared ramp.  A 20 ms delay was included to allow
the model to reach a sustained \RMP. The ChS model unit had CF of
3.872 kHz due to the separation of frequency channels in the model.
The best parameters found by the optimisation and shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CSresults}, were very high excitatory input (\wLSRTS =
2.86796 nS, \wHSRTS = 2.01089 nS) and moderate to high inhibition
(\wDSTS 0.291181 nS, \wTVTS 0.884174 nS, \wGLGTS 0.749812 nS).  A low
input stimulus level means that the majority of synaptic input came
from \HSR fibres.  There was a slight increase in the leak conductance
($\gleak=6.57345e-4 \textrm{S/cm}^2$ ) from the initial value
(4.907e-4), causing a decrease in the input resistance to 120
M$\Omega$ from 163 M$\Omega$.  The final error, calculated with more
weight on the CV variables, was 0.839952.  Post-tone hyperpolarisation
(reference 1.30035, best \ChS model -0.029843) and the first \CV value
(ref 0.1543, best \ChS model 0.49706) had the greatest difference.
The poor initial \CV response is due to the irregular first spike.
The large excitatory \HSR input causes spikes occurring after tone
onset, just before the stimulus invoked spike arrival at the \TS cell
3 ms later, but still included in the \CV calculation.

\yellownote{Note the ChS optimisation had added weight to the CV values
in the error calculation.  The PSTH and IV trace do not even show a
decent chopping behaviour.}  \yellownote{The peaks for the IV are 3.66,
6.77, and 10.99 ms. The AN model input is affected by the rat audiogram,
the low CF and low level.  This shifts the arrival time of spikes to the
TS model, and a raw IV comparison would need to be shifted by approx 2
ms. The onset ratio and the first CV value are effected by this.}

\yellownote{Synaptic weight in the model above 0.002 will initiate a
spike at each input spike, similar to the calyx synapse on bushy
cells. This means that the TS cell will respond with a primary-like or
primary with notch PSTH. Dendritic filtering could improve this but the
high synaptic weights do not seem like a realistic physiological option
for small bouton endings in the CN.}

\yellownote{The RMP of the experimental data was relatively high, and if
this was produced in a model the spontaneous rate would be close to 100
spikes per seconds.  The IV measures allow for comparison of the
experimental and model data that is independent of the RMP.}

\yellownote{Hand tuning creates many types of ChS models, but the best
effects are when you smooth out the input with dendritic filtering.
This can be used in a single compartment using a higher time constant on
the synapse or better, using a double-exponential synapse with longer
onset and decay time constants. Very high excitatory inputs saturates
the cell and it will spike repeatedly in a regular fashion but the onset
is too precise. See ChT2 IV trace for an example of precise onset. I was
able to generated a good IV trace when the full trace was the error
function at higher SPL and higher CF, but this was unable to generate
the same trace for 3.9 KHz at 40 dB or a sustained CV. }

*** Transient Chopper 1

The \ChT1 unit chosen for the optimisation was unit 01-857-007, CF=8.2
kHz \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The depolarisation threshold for
this unit was 55 dB \SPL, close to the average 47.2 dB \SPL for all
\ChT1 units.  The stimulus for the optimisation routine was an 85 dB 8.2
kHz pure tone and the exemplar \TS cell model had CF 8.27 kHz.

The optimisation results of \ChT1 ares shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CT1results} with a final error of 0.839141 without weighting.
Moderate excitatory synaptic weights (\wLSRTS 0.000822193, \wHSRTS
0.000620294) is balanced with moderate to low glycinergic synaptic input
(\wDSTS 0.000148518, \wTVTS 0.000195416).  The GABAergic input weight
was very low (\wGLGTS 1.70742e-05), but the loud input stimulus (85 dB)
would cause reasonable inhibition to the \TS cell throughout the
stimulus.  The leak conductance had a slight decrease (\gleak
0.000409819).

*** Transient Chopper 2

The exemplar \ChT2 unit (01-305-014, CF 12.4 kHz
\citep*{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}), has a low depolarising threshold (5
dB \SPL) so the stimulus is set to 35 dB \SPL.  This second
transiently adapting chopper unit's difference to \ChT1 is reflected
in its average membrane potential and \CV.  \ChT2 has a higher
reduction in onset depolarization (90.2\%) compared to ChT1, and
post-tone inhibition is greater (8.82 mV).

* TODO Discussion 

\yellownote{Discuss the relevance of creating the CN stellate model,
  especially the methods.}

The T stellate cell microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus is one of the
most interesting neural features of the auditory system.  It enables a
high fidelity sensory input to be passed to higher order centres, by
reproducing the spectrum in a robust fashion
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003} and synchronisation to significant
periodic frequencies \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

** Verification of CN Cell Models

*** Golgi Cell Model

Section [[*Golgi Cell Model: Monotonic Rate Level Responses in
Marginal Shell Units][Golgi Cell Model]]

\yellownote{Discuss the Golgi cell optimisation.  Is the filter-based
  approach effective at meeting the goal of simulating data from
  GhoshalKim:1997. The Golgi cell model optimised in Section
  \ref{GolgiOpt} reproduces the experimental data of a single unit in
  the marginal shell of the VCN \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.}

*** D Stellate Cell Model

Discuss Section [[*D Stellate Cell Model: Optimisation Using Click
Recovery Responses][D Stellate Cell Model]]

\yellownote{Discuss the DS cell model optimisation.  What were the
reasons for using cell-based parameters, and why is this necessary?
Why aren't the spread of ANF inputs to DS cells optimised based on
your methods?  How does the optimisation routine replicate DS
responses to other stimuli, when there are already plenty?}

*** Tuberculoventral Cell Model

Discuss Sections [[*Tuberculoventral Cell Model: Optimisation Using
Tone and Noise Rate Level Responses][Tuberculoventral Cell Model]] and
[[*Asymmetry of Wide-band Inhibition to Tuberculoventral Cells:
Optimisation Using Notch Noise Responses in TV Cells][Asymmetry of
Wide-band Inhibition to Tuberculoventral Cells]]

\yellownote{Discuss the TV cell optimisation. Is the goal of
replicating wide-band inhibition offset necessary, or is rate ratio
between TS/DS/TV the most important?  Mammalian studies show that the
TV cells receive input from TS cells, but not in rats}

*** Chopper Subtypes: T Stellate Cell Models

The primary purpose of this optimisation study set out with the aim of
pin-pointing the network parameters that regulate the major output of
the CN stellate microcircuit.




** Limitations of the CN stellate microcircuit model



\yellownote{AM coding in model is not verified by
\citet{ZilanyBruce:2006} model, and it was superseded by the addition
of a power-law functions in the synapse \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}}

* Conclusion 

[[*Optimisation%20Results][Optimisation Results]]

# Example conclusion The purpose for performing the experiments herein
# was to gain insights into the functional relevance of the type II
# neurons by analyzing their endogenous firing features. The observed
# elec- trophysiological diversity between the two classes of primary
# au- ditory neurons argues for different roles for the type I and II
# neurons. In contrast to the type I spiral ganglion neurons, the type
# II neurons show markedly distinct kinetics and receive a classically
# convergent innervation pattern that is also present in other sensory
# systems. Like the rod neural circuitry in the retina, the type II
# spiral ganglion neurons appear to be designed to inte- grate input
# from the many receptors that they innervate. This would have very
# little impact, however, on signal detection with- out the process of
# temporal summation. The slow kinetics of the type II spiral ganglion
# neurons, along with their ability to respond at relatively
# hyperpolarized voltage levels, are features consistent with mechanisms
# designed to detect low-intensity stimuli.

\yellownote{More editing in chapter conclusion}

The purpose for performing the optimisation experiments herein was to
develop a biophysically-realistic neural network model of the stellate
microcircuit.  The methods used in this section are a practical and
realistic means for constructing microcircuits with sensory or
feature-based topography; but requires extensive experimental evidence
about the behaviour of each interneuron in the network.  The tabular
format for neural network modelling as suggested by
\citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} was followed so that other researchers
can easily reproduce this work.
