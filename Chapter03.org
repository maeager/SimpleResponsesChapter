# \citet{Shamma:1998} calls upon the neuroscience community to investigate the role of populations of neurons in neurophysiology.  To do so, 
This chapter draws on the wealth of experimental data accumulated in auditory
neuroscience to create a detailed \BNN model of the \TS microcircuit in the \CN
(the \CNSM model, as described in Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}).  The design and methods used for the construction of
the model provide insights relevant to other neural network models of the brain,
especially those that use sensory pathways.

Despite advances in computational neuroscience, it remains a challenging task to
develop an accurate representation of the complex behaviour of real neural
networks.  Choices, guesses and assumptions continue to be required in
neuronal modelling \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}.  With the acceleration of
computational power and enhanced experimental techniques in multi-unit
recordings, it is possible to develop more detailed neural models. There is much
to be gained from biophysically-realistic modelling approaches, especially in
the thoroughly investigated \CN of mammals, bats and birds.

# TODO: think about linking to end of methods chapter.  I.e. reproducbable research

# TODO: See neural detail in auditory
# system\citep{LuRubioEtAl:2008}
# Discuss use of Poisson
# models vs HH-like models.  Discuss single cell simulation vs whole
# network simulation during optimisation.

To develop and optimise detailed neural models and neural network models,
reproducible research methods are required.  In this chapter, the table method
introduced by \citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is used to summarise
the neural models used in each optimisation step (as described in
Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}).
# The Nordlie tables shown in
# each optimisation stage consist of A) the model summary, B) cell type
# populations, C) connectivity between two cell types, D) neuron and
# synapse models, and E) optimisation parameters.
# This method aims to
# show a consistent and recognisable format for presenting various
# neural network models and their constituents.
In order to create a realistic microcircuit, the parameter optimisation routine
was developed in sequential stages.  The connections within the \CNSM
model (Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}) were developed using such a sequential
method of optimisation steps.  Parameters in the microcircuit can be separated
into two classes: cell-based and connectivity-based.  The cell-based parameters
for each cell model in the \CNSM model, discussed in Section
\ref{sec:Methods:CellModels}, remain relatively fixed. The connectivity-based
parameters, introduced in Section \ref{sec:Methods:ConnParameters}, are the main
focus of this chapter.  The parameters in the sequential optimisation stages
were chosen so that they did not influence the properties of previously fitted
parameters.  The parameters of each cell type were based on
experimental data or optimised on the basis of responses to simple
stimuli. Each cell type was typified with its characteristic \PSTH in response
to short tone bursts
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}, and the \EIRA to
tones across the frequency spectrum \citep{Evans:1992}.
# The process methods for optimisation were described in Section
# \ref{sec:Methods:Optimisation}, [[*Optimisation%20Techniques][Optimisation Techniques]].

# These included specifying the model to be optimised,
# the criteria, and the parameters and the constraints of
# the model, and implementing the optimisation.
# The restricted network models optimised in each section are presented in their
# Background sub-section.   
# Criteria to be satisfied are presented in Implementation
# sections by specifying the experimental data set, the stimulus and the
# recorded output analysis required.  Parameters and constraints of the
# model are also presented in the Implementation section and the
# accompanying Nordlie table.  Optimisation results are presented in the
# Results section of each step.

** Cochlear Nucleus Stellate Microcircuit Model 

\glsunset{GABA}

The \CNSM model shown in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit} comprises the following cells:
1. \HSR and \LSR\space \ANFs : A phenomenological auditory model provides spiking
   input to \CN neurons across frequencies and spontaneous rate types of the
   \ANFs from an arbitrary input stimulus \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  The
   baseline in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit} is a representation of \ANFs from
   low \CF to high \CF (left to right). The model reproduces responses for high
   and \LSR\space \ANFs at 100 channels across the frequency range 200 Hz to 48
   kHz.
2. \GLG cell: A \GABA-ergic \VCN marginal shell unit that is presumed to
   regulate excitability in the \GCD and core \VCN units
   \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Only one /in vivo/ study has recorded
   extracellular data in the marginal shell area of the \CN
   \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The presumed characteristics of \GLG cells are
   taken from that study and are defined by a monotonic response to tones and
   noise, a Type I\slash III \EIRA, and an unusual or chopper \PSTH.
3. \DS cell: A large, glycinergic, multipolar neuron with \OnC\space \PSTH
   response that acts as a coincidence detector.  Its large dendritic area
   increases its response to noise, allowing it to behave as a wide-band
   inhibitor in the \VCN, \DCN, and contralateral \CN
   \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
4. \TV cell: A glycinergic, Type II \EIRA unit in the deep layer of the \DCN
   \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  This cell acts as a delayed echo-suppressor
   and narrow-band inhibitor, with recurrent connections between \DS and \TS
   cells in the \VCN
   \citep{Alibardi:2006,OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991}.
5. \TS cell: One of the major output projection cells of the \CN to the
   \IC and the primary output of the \CNSM model.  This
   multipolar neuron has been shown to have robust spectral representation and
   enhanced synchronisation to modulation in speech sounds
   \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

Optimisation of a detailed \BNN model requires a realistic input model with
which to mimic the behaviour observed in live neural networks.  For a detailed
neural model of the \CN, a realistic and phenomenologically robust auditory
periphery model is needed to represent sounds and transformations that occur in
the central auditory system.  The input to the \CNSM model, the \ANFs, is
discussed in the next section. To further fit the parameters of the \CNSM model,
a simple and sequential method was applied to each of the cell types using
experimental data.

# \yellownote{Note Final draft: This paragraph has been converted to past tense based on assertion of facts about the physiology and processes, not necessarily about how the model was designed.}  

The order of the optimisation routines is important because of the
inter-dependencies within the isofrequency microcircuit and across the whole
nucleus. In the \CNSM model, Golgi cells only received inputs from the \ANFs and
are the first model and network parameters to be optimised. \DS cells are
modeled next because they receive inputs from \ANFs and \GABA-ergic Golgi
cells. The \TV cells' input network parameters are optimised next as they are
strongly inhibited by \DS cells and receive excitation from \ANFs. Input
parameters to \TS cells, which received inputs from all other cell types in the
\CNSM model, are optimised last.

Due to the variety of possible inputs to \TS cells (and the observed
physiological classification sub-types in chopper units), three \TS cell model
sub-types were optimised.  Glycinergic input to \DS cells from \TV cells and
other \DS cells was not included due to their weak effects /in vitro/
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} and the added complexity of a negative
feedback loop in the microcircuit.  Recurrent synaptic connection between \TS
cells have been the focus of recent neural models
\citep{BahmerLangner:2006,BahmerLangner:2006a,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}.  They were
not included in the \CNSM model because of the rarity of small round vesicles on
\ChS units \citep{SmithRhode:1989}. Additionally,
\citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} reported that \EPSPs in one \TS cell were
likely to come from only one input. Given the weak influence of \TS cell
recurrent connections, they were not included in the \CNSM model.

** Auditory Nerve Fibre Model 

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Methods:HSRLSR}, the \ANF inputs to the \CNSM
model neurons were drawn from the Carney \AN model \citep{Carney:1993}, a phenomenological auditory
periphery model.  This chapter uses
more recent derivations of the Carney model: the Bruce model
\citep{BruceSachsEtAl:2003,ZilanyBruce:2006,ZilanyBruce:2007} and the Zilany
model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.
# Three \ANF  the ARLO model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001}, the
# The auditory model consists of an outer\slash middle ear pre-processing
# filter, a cochlea filterbank, IHC-to-AN synapse model and dead-time
# modified Poisson spike generator, as shown in Figure
# \ref{fig:ZilanyBruceFig}.  \citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated
# cochlea filters based on the critical bandwidths obtained from
# psychophysical experiments in humans.  The ARLO model of the cat
# auditory periphery, with non-linear compression and two-tone
# suppression, is used in this study except in the vowel simulation where
# the human auditory periphery model is used.


# AN model paragraph has been changed - fix any comment related to new
# Zilany

# The \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007} model improves the previous AN model by
# an additional signal path and its predictions have matched a wide
# range of physiological data in normal and impaired cat data. The
# most recent AN model comprises an power-law synapse model, with
# internal $1/f$ noise, that enhances the behaviour of long-term
# dependence in ANFs \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.

# TODO Why is it the cat model? updating Carney model? Updating
#   of the Carney auditory model has led to the change in the model's
#   configuration from an original implementation of the rat model.  The
#   default species is the cat and will be used in the data presented in
#   this chapter.

# ** Spiking in Poisson Neural Models 

The neural models used in the \ANFs and Golgi cell model were inhomogeneous
Poisson processes.  The instantaneous rate produced the input \AN model (chosen
from the Bruce or Zilany model) and was passed through the Jackson spiking model
\citep{Jackson:2003,JacksonCarney:2005}, which includes refractory effects
typical of \ANFs.  Spike trains for each neuron in the \AN model were
created at the start of each repetition of the stimulus.  
# Further detail on \HSR and \LSR\space \ANF models were in Section \ref{sec:Methods:HSRLSR}.

# Analysis of the frequency
# response area of ANF generates known parameters for each fibre, these are:
# 
# - the spontaneous rate (SR), generated in silence and is
#   categoried into two groups High SR (\gt 18 sp/s) and Low SR (\lt 18  sp/s);
# - threshold, the sound pressure level(SPL) at which the cell
#   responds above the spontaneous rate
# - characteristic frequency (CF)
# 

** Neural Models

Single-compartment \HH-like neural models were used for the \DS, \TV
and \TS cells in the \CNSM model.  The \RM neural model is a conductance-based
neural model with membrane current models developed by
\citet{RothmanManis:2003b}. The \CNSM model makes extensive use of the \RM
neural model, which was discussed in detail in Section
\ref{sec:Methods:CellModels}.
# in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}.

# Type I-c classic regular firing contains a voltage-activated
# sodium, high threshold potassium, and hyperpolarisation mixed-cation,
# and leak current channels.  This neural model an integrator and is
# strongly influenced by the \Ih current, which is active at rest.  Type
# I-t transient regular firing type is similar to the Type 1 classic but
# with A-type potassium current channels.  A-type potassium channels are
# unique to the cochlear nucleus, particularly to \TS cells
# \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}.  \DS cells contain
# low-threshold potassium current channels, which is strongest in bushy
# cells, to enhance response to coincident inputs.

# TODO: Discuss RM model (put in Methods Chapter).  Perhaps expand
#   more on the role of the currents on each neuron in the CN model.

** Connectivity and Network Parameters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:ConnectivityNetworkParameters
   :END:

Tonotopic connectivity in the \CNSM model was defined by the regular
organisation of afferent \ANFs into distinct isofrequency channels.  The
channels were separated using even spatial distance (based on the basilar
membrane frequency sensitivity) with centre frequency calculated by the
Greenwood function for the cat
\citep[see~Chapter~\ref{sec:MethodsChapter},][]{Greenwood:1990}.  The \HSR\space \ANF
terminals of individual fibres generally cover 70 \um and \LSR fibres cover 100
\um in mice \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988,OertelWu:1989}.

Figure \ref{fig:CNconn} shows the Gaussian distribution of connections between
cell types in the \CN. The \CFs of the \CN channels were separated using the
same Greenwood function used for the filterbank of \AN frequency channels.

** Synapse Models

\glsunset{AMPA}\glsunset{GlyR}\glsunset{NMDA}

The synaptic models for \AMPA, \GlyR and \GABAA receptors were described in
Section \ref{sec:Methods:SynapseModels}.  The synapses act by changing the
conductivity at a single point in the neural compartment with either single or
double exponential dynamics.  All weight variables (in microsiemens) and delay
parameters (in milliseconds) are the same for each synapse in a connectivity
group.

# \ref{sec:Methods:SynapseModels}

** Synaptic Jitter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:Jitter
   :END:

Precise onset cues are a critical feature of the auditory pathway, especially for
the localisation of sounds.  In modeling the \CN, onset precision is essential
for enhancing periodic stimuli in \TS cells \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997} and
echo-suppression in \TV cells \citep{BurckHemmen:2007,WickesbergOertel:1990}.
Stochastic behaviour at the \IHC-\AN synapse limits the onset encoding
performance in the \AN.  Jitter of the \FSL is commonly measured by the standard
deviation; jitter in \ANFs is 0.73 ms \citep{RhodeOertelEtAl:1983}.  Most units
in the \VCN exhibit reduced onset jitter through sampling multiple \ANFs, but
onset units like \DS cells have additional morphological and intrinsic
specialisations for greater onset precision.

# Units that encode the precise time of arrival
# would be of utility for such a system in deter-
# mining the sound location. The onset cells en-
# code the start of sound more precisely than
# any other group of neurons in the cochlear
# nucleus. 
# \OC units exhibit a particularly small
# variability in first spike latency between units,
# whereas a given Oc unit also has the smallest
# amount of noise in the time of occurrence of
# the first spike to a series of tone stimuli. The
# standard deviation of the first spike is usually
# between 20 and 50 \mus and
#  it was common to
# have every first spikein an Oc response to 250
# tone pips occurring in a lOO-ps interval. This
# compares with a 730 ps average in the jitter
# of \ANFs. Other onset units also
# had a much smaller fluctuation in latency than
# auditory fibres. 

A random jitter was introduced to the \AN synaptic delay to account for \ANF
variation and synapses placed at various distances along the dendrites of \TS,
\DS and \TV cells.  Figure \ref{fig:CSjitter} shows the effects of jitter on the
intracellular responses of a Type I-t \RM neural model
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}, averaged over 25 repetitions. Jitter was added
separately to each \ANF synapse using an absolute Gaussian distribution random
number with standard deviation of 0.1 ms and mean dependent on the cell type
(e.g. \dANFTS). The effect of adding jitter to individual \ANF synapses in the
\CNSM model was to increase the mean and standard deviation of \FSL in \CN
neurons. These effects replicated dendritic delays without the added
computational cost of a passive neural compartment in the model.  The models did
not account for dendritic attenuation of the \EPSP.

#+caption: [Response of TS cells to isolated synaptic inputs with variable delays]{Intracellular membrane voltage response of a TS cell model (Type I-t RM model) to isolated synaptic inputs with variable delays.

** Synaptic Delay Additional Parameter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:Delays
   :END:

The effective delay of the \AN model does not take into account the conduction
and synaptic transmission delay in reaching post-synaptic neurons in the \CNSM
model. Accordingly, an additional delay component was required in each of the
synaptic connections in the \CNSM model involving \ANFs.  Mean \FSL to short \CF
tones and click stimuli were used to set delay times between \ANFs and \CN cells
\citep{RhodeSmith:1986,RhodeOertelEtAl:1983,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The additional delay was defined using the \FSL of high frequency units as the
sum of the \ANFs' \FSL, \ANF conduction delay and the synaptic transmission
delay.  The first spike latency measured in high \CF units in the ARLO \AN model
\citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} for \HSR fibres was 1.5 ms.


Table \ref{tab:Methods:AddDelay} shows the additional delay component for each
cell type, calculated from population statistics, to ensure the first spike
latency in the models matched the experimental data.  The models were derived
from the basic \RM neural models \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The relative
difference between the \DS cell model's mean \FSL and the other Type I cell
types can be attributed to the additional \IKLT channels in the Type I-II \RM
neural model.  \IKLT is active at \RMP and decreases the overall input
resistance and membrane time constant, reducing the time to fire an action
potential.  \TS cells were designed with the Type I-t \RM model, which contains
an additional \IKA channel current over the Type I-c \RM model, but were not
significantly different from the classic Type I \RM models in \TV cell models.

The time step of the numerical integration performed in each of the simulations
in the chapter was 0.05 ms.  Input spikes for Poisson neural models (\HSR, \LSR
and Golgi cell models) were calculated at the start of repetitions.

** Optimisation Routine

The optimisation routine used in this chapter was NEURON's [[latex:progname][fit\_praxis]] function,
which uses the principal axis algorithm \citep[PRAXIS,~][]{Brent:1976}. The
PRAXIS method returns the minimum of the fitness function of /n/ variables using
the principal axis method without using the function's gradient.  The fitness
function converts the parameters to a single measure by simulating the \CNSM
model using the parameters, then comparing selected neural outputs to
experimental data.  \Gls{RMS} error was used as the comparison measure
of similar data points, e.g.\space mean firing rate at different sound levels in
a rate-level simulation.  Mean error relative to the expected or target values
was also used to ensure there is no bias between data points with large variation
in differences.

** Verification of Cell Model Responses to Simple Tones and Noise

To verify the optimisation processes, a suite of tests was run across the whole
\CNSM model. The purpose of these simulations was to ensure the optimised
parameters could be used across all frequency channels.  These simulations
show the response of a \CNSM model neuron at the centre of the network to
tones corresponding to its \CF, broad-band noise and a combination of tones and
noise. Responses of all model neurons across the network (one cell type for each
frequency channel) were recorded during the verification procedure.  The stimuli
presented to the \CNSM model included:
1. Rate-level response to pure tones at the characteristic frequency of the
   centre channel of the network, 5.81 kHz. The sound level was varied from 0 to
   90 dB SPL.
2. Rate-level response to white noise at levels 0 to 100 dB SPL.
3. Masked rate-level response with pure tones varied in level from 0 to 100 dB
   SPL and simultaneous withe noise at 50 dB SPL.

** Background

*** Morphology of Golgi Cells


\GLG cells are distinguishable from the numerous smaller granule cells in the
\GCD by their larger cell body and surrounding plexus of dendritic and axonal
neurites. The soma diameter of \GLG cells is approximately 15 \um
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, while the diameter of granule cells is 8 \um
in cats \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980} and 6 \um in rats and mice
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,Alibardi:2003}.  Smooth, tapering dendrites,
between 50 and 100 \um long, emanate in all directions
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Cant:1993,MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}.  A dense,
axonal plexus, limited to the plane of the \GCD, extends approximately 250 \um
from the soma in all directions
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,BensonBrown:2004}.

# In layer 2 of the DCN Alibardi rat (9–15 \um) GABA-ergic cells round cell body
# surrounded by small granule cells immuno-negative to Glycine and GABA.

The dendrites of \VCN\space \GLG cells are mitochondria-rich and make glomeruli
complexes with long synaptic junctions, with mossy fibre boutons
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}. The somata generally have few boutons of the flat
or pleomorphic vesicle type, that are characteristic of glycinergic and
GABAergic terminals. Along with inhibitory boutons, the dendrites also receive
excitatory input with large (Type I \ANF) and small (Type II \ANF and granule
cell) vesicles
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Ryugo:2008}.

#  \citep{Alibardi:2003} In non-tonotopic circuits integration between acoustic
# and non-acoustic inputs occurs \citep{RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993}.
The contribution of the circuits of granule cell areas of the \CN
to the processing of the acoustic signal is poorly understood
\citep[for~a~review~of~non-auditory~inputs~to~\GCD~see~][]{OhlroggeDoucetEtAl:2001}.
\citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} confirmed the excitation of Golgi cells from
granule cells with \NMDA glutamatergic synapses.

# # from Mugnaini This paper describes the fine structure of granule cells and
# granule-associated interneurons (termed Golgi cells) in the cochlear nuclei of
# cat, rat and mouse.  Granule cells and Golgi cells are present in defined
# regions of ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei collectively termed "cochlear
# granule cell domain'. The granule cells are small neurons with two or three
# short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with terminal
# expansions. These participate in glomerular synaptic arrays similar to those
# of the cerebellar cortex. In the glomeruli the dendrites form short Type 1
# synapses with a large, centrally-located mossy bouton containing round
# synaptic vesicles and Type 2 synapses with peripherally located, smaller
# boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles. The granule cell axons is thin and
# beaded and, on its way to the molecular layer of the \DCN, takes a straight
# course, which in ventral nucleus is parallel to the pial surface. Neurons of
# the second category resemble cerebellar Golgi cells and occur everywhere
# interspersed among the granule cells. They are usually larger than the granule
# cells and give rise to dendrites which may branch close to and curve around
# the cell body. The dendrites contain numerous mitochondria and are laden with
# thin appendages, giving them a hairy appearance.  Both the cell body and the
# stem dendrites participate in glomerular synaptic arrays.  Golgi cell
# glomeruli are distinguishable from the granule cell glomeruli by unique
# features of the dendritic profiles and by longer, Type 1 synaptic junctions
# with the central mossy bouton.  The Golgi cell axon forms a beaded plexus
# close to the parent cell body. The synaptic vesicle population of the mossy
# boutons suggests that they are a heterogeneous group and may have multiple
# origins.  Apparently, each of the various classes participates in both granule
# and Golgi cell glomeruli.  The smaller peripheral boutons with pleomorphic
# vesicles in the two types of glomeruli may represent Golgi cell axons which
# make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell axons
# which make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell
# dendrites, on the other hand, are also contacted by small boutons en passant
# with round synaptic vesicles, which may represent granule cell axons. A
# tentative scheme of the circuitry in the cochlear granule cell domain is
# presented. The similarity with the cerebellar granule cell layer is striking.

*** Cellular Mechanisms of Golgi Cells

In a single study in mice, intracellular recordings of \GLG cells showed a
classic repetitively-firing response to current clamp and an inward rectifying
response to voltage clamp \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}. \GLG cells are
classified as Type I current-clamp neurons and act as simple integrators of
synaptic input \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
# Their intrinsic properties suggests \GLG cells are simple integrators.
Response to \AN shocks in \GLG cells were found to be delayed by approximately
0.7 ms relative to the core \VCN units, with minimum delay in most cells around
1.3 ms \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

*** Acoustic Response of Golgi cells

# The physiological response of \GLG cells has not been extensively studied.

Extracellular recordings from labelled \GLG cells are not available in the
literature; however, electrophysiological studies of the \GCD (or marginal shell
of the \VCN in cats) have been done without direct labelling of recorded units
\citep{Ghoshal:1997,GhoshalKim:1997,GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a}.  Any
extracellular spikes recorded in the \GCD are most likely from Golgi cells since
granule cell somata are less than 10 \um and their narrow axons are unlikely to
elicit electrical activity in the electrodes
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

Figure \ref{fig:GhoshalKim97Fig2} shows an example of the acoustically-driven
marginal shell units in the \VCN.  Strongly driven units in the anterior \VCN
shell exhibit non-saturating rate-level functions to pure tones, noise or both
with dynamic ranges as wide as 89 dB \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The majority of
\GCD units recorded by \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} were classified as Type I\slash
III or III \EIRA units, showing a monotonic increase in firing rate with
increasing sound intensity to tones and noise. Some units showed Type II or Type
IV \EIRA properties. One unit was classified as Type II due to its poor response
to noise but it did not show a reduction of response to tones at high \SPL,
typical of \DCN Type II units \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. Two units with low \CF
(\lt 1.5 kHz) were classified as Type II \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. The \PSTH of
the units included wide chopper, \OnC, and pause-build; however,
nearly one third of units did not fit into the known classifications and were
called "unusual" \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.

The latency of acoustically driven \GCD recorded units ranges from 2.4 ms to
over 10 ms, with a mean of 3.75 ms.  The acoustic latency closely matches the
minimum latency of \EPSPs to \AN shocks recorded in mice /in vitro/ preparations
\citep[1.3~ms,][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}. \EPSPs with longer latencies may
be due to Type II \ANFs, which have an estimated theoretical latency of 10 ms
\citep{Brown:1993}, or from polysynaptic excitation by granule cells.

# Their monotonic responses to tones and noise over a wide dynamic range
# provides regulation of activity in granule cells that also receive
# non-acoustic input.  The contribution of a delayed, negative feedback
# onto \VCN~units is analogous to automatic gain control.  provides
# strong evidence for regulation of activity in granule cells.
#
# GABA in the Ventral Cochlear Nucleus
# {Neuromodulatory effects of \GLG cells}

The assumed functional role of \GLG cells is to regulate granule cells.  They
may also provide automatic gain control to the principal \VCN units, primarily
DS and TS cells \citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The
presence of GABAergic inputs to \VCN and \DCN neurons has been verified by
labeled terminals adjacent to the soma and dendrites
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,BabalianRyugoEtAl:2003} and
release from inhibition in their response areas with ionotopopheretic
application of the \GABAa antagonist, bicuculine
\citep{EvansZhao:1998,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The source of GABAergic inputs to cells in the mammalian \CN is somewhat
contentious.  Studies show that GABAergic inputs to the \CN generally arise in
the peri-olivary regions of the medulla in cats \citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997}
and birds \citep{LachicaRubsamenEtAl:1995,YangMonsivaisEtAl:1999}.  Slice
preparations of the isolated murine \VCN show strong and immediate sensitivity
to bicuculine in TS and DS cells from a source within the \CN complex
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The only known source of \GABA intrinsic to
the \VCN is the \GLG cells of the \GCD overlying the \VCN
\citep{Mugnaini:1985,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

Inputs to \GLG cells are more complicated than the inputs to core \VCN neurons.
\GLG cells are sparse in the \GCD, surrounded by the many smaller excitatory
granule cells that form small en-passant endings.  Type II \ANFs create diffuse
glutamatergic release sites in the \GCD
\citep{HurdHutsonEtAl:1999,BensonBrown:2004} that may stimulate \NMDA glutamate
receptors in \GLG cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

** Implementation

The key cell attributes that informed the creation of the
\GLG cell model for use in the \CNSM model were as follows:
 1. \GLG cells are classic integrator neurons, as shown by their Type I current
    clamp response \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
 2. The minimum \EPSP in \GLG cells to an electric shock of the \AN
    \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} and mean first spike latency to acoustic
    stimuli \citep{GhoshalKim:1997} are significantly different from the core
    \VCN units.
 3. \GLG cells have a low maximum rate and large dynamic range to tone and noise
    stimuli \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.
 4. The low threshold in \GLG cells can\-not be solely due to \LSR fibre inputs
    that have high thresholds \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. This suggests medium and
    high spontaneous rate Type I or Type II \ANFs (that project to the \GCD) may
    provide weak inputs to \GLG cells.  The lack of extensive experimental data
    regarding Type II \ANF units and granule cell response to acoustic input,
    reward an inhomogeneous Poisson rate neural model over the Hodgkin-Huxley
    type neural model in the \GLG cell used in the \CNSM model. Although \HSR
    \ANF terminals do not generally project into the \GCD, they were included in
    the \CNSM model to provide some low level spontaneous activity.

The\space \GLG cell model was implemented as an instantaneous-rate Poisson rate
model, as shown in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}D and in Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiDiagram}. The primary inputs were from the \HSR and \LSR\space \ANF
models' instantaneous rate outputs with connections across frequency channels.
The strength of \HSR and \LSR\space \ANF inputs to \GLG cells was determined by a
Gaussian distribution in units of channel separation in the network.  The weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w}_{\HSRGLG}$ and $\mathbf{w}_{\LSRGLG}$, span the \CNSM
model's channels with size \Nchannels, with a normal curve centred on the
position in the channel and variance \sANFGLG.  For example, for \LSR inputs
to \GLG cells, at position /i/ in the frequency channels, the weight vector was
modified by the weight parameter \wLSRGLG, and the spread parameter \sLSRGLG,
which is the variance in a standard Gaussian function
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
    \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GolgiWeights}
  \mathbf{w}_{\LSRGLG} (i,x)= \wLSRGLG \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\,\pi\,\sLSRGLG}} \exp\left(\frac{-(x-i)^2}{2 \sLSRGLG}\right),
    \end{equation} 
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $x=1,\ldots,\Nchannels$.

The intermediate step in the \GLG cell model, $g_i(t)$, combines the weighted
sum of \HSR and \LSR instantaneous-rate and corrects the output rate for the
desired spontaneous activity, \Gspon, and is given by
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:GolgiInputSum}
  \textrm{g}_i(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{\Nchannels}{\mathbf{w}_{\LSRGLG}(j) {\rm LSR}_j(t) + \mathbf{w}_{\HSRGLG}(j) {\rm HSR}_j(t)}  - \textrm{\Gspon}.
  \end{equation} 
#+END_LaTeX
The length of the instantaneous rate profiles of \HSR and \LSR models (and
consequently \GLG models) were determined by the stimulus duration and sampling
rate ($N_{\rm stim}$ = stimulus duration / sampling rate). Profiles were
calculated for each channel in the network (size=\Nchannels) and stored for use
during repeated simulations.

The weighted sum of \HSR and \LSR instantaneous-rate vectors was convolved with
a smoothing kernel, mimicking synaptic and dendritic properties of the \GLG cell
model. The smoothing kernel is an alpha function, $\alpha_{\rm GLG }(t)$, given
by
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GolgiAlpha}
  \alpha_{\rm GLG}(t) =	 t\, \exp\left(\frac{-t}{\Gtau}\right),\quad t\ge 0. 
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The smoothing kernel was normalised by setting the area under the function
to 1. For a large enough filter length, the alpha function integral
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
    \begin{equation}
  \int_0^\infty \alpha(t) dt = (-\Gtau^2 - t\,\Gtau) \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\Gtau}\right)
    \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent equals $\Gtau^2$ as /t/ approaches infinity.
# In this case $10 \times \Gtau$ is used for the filter duration.
The convolution of the weighted inputs, /g/ with normalised smoothing kernel,
used a discrete convolution method and was cropped to the length of the input
stimulus,
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GolgiConvolution}
  \textrm{GLG}_{i}(t) =\sum_{u=0}^{u=N_{\alpha}} \frac{1}{\Gtau^2} \alpha_{\textrm{GLG}}(u)  g_{i}(t-u),
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $N_\alpha=10\,\Delta{t}\,\Gtau$ is the length of the smoothing
kernel and $\Delta{t}=0.05$ is the time step of the \ANF input rate vectors.
The inhomogenenous Poisson spiking model with refractory effects (as used for
the \ANF models \citep{Jackson:2004}) was used to generate the output spike
times for the \GLG cell model.

Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary} summarises the model used to optimise the
\GLG cell model.
# As explained in the Chapter

The topology of the \VCN follows the same tonotopic organisation of the \AN,
with 100 evenly-spaced frequency channels.  As Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}B shows, the \ANFs were not required because only
the instantaneous profile of each \AN frequency channel was used in the \GLG
cell model.  In the \CNSM model, the connectivity between \ANFs and \GLG cells
(Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}C) was a simple place-based Gaussian
spread (as explained in Section \ref{sec:Methods:ConnectivityandTopology}).


The experimental data used to optimise the \GLG cell model was the rate level
response of the marginal shell unit shown in Figure \ref{fig:GhoshalKim97Fig2}.
This unit was chosen due to its monotonic response to pure \BF tones and its
moderate maximal firing rate (100 spikes per second). The closest frequency
channel to the experimental unit's \CF (21 kHz) was used for the \GLG cell model
(channel 76, \CF=22.7 kHz). The fitness function for the \GLG cell model
optimisation used 22.7 kHz pure tones at 22 sound levels to compare the
experimental and model units. The \GLG cell model parameters used in the
optimisation are shown in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}E.

** Optimisation Results

# # COMMENT OUT UNUSED FIGURE AND TEXT
# Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult} shows the output of the test
# optimisation trials for the \GLG cell model.	 The testing trial used
# only five sound levels (0, 15, 55, 75 and 85 dB \SPL) and detected the
# mean rate from the instantaneous profile in its fitting routine.  The
# best response obtained a minimum root mean squared error of 11.63
# spikes/sec against the five points in the target experimental data of
# unit S03-07  \citep[CF~21~kHz][]{GhoshalKim:1996a}.  A rate-level
# curve (green circles, Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult}) was generated
# from the spiking output to show the discrepancy in the
# spike-based rate-level and the monotonic rate based rate-level.  The
# lack of low level response and a higher threshold indicated the need
# for some \HSR input into the \GLG cell model.

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiResult} shows the rate-level output of the \GLG cell model
with its optimal combination of parameters as shown in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}E.  Twenty two sound levels from -15 dB SPL to 90
dB SPL were used in the fitness function to compare the \GLG cell model
(\CF=22.7 kHz) with the experimental unit S03-07
\citep[\CF=21~kHz,][]{GhoshalKim:1996a} representing the target response.  The
mean firing rate, generated from 25 repetitions at each level, was used in the
fitness function to produce a square root of the mean squared difference between
the model response and the target response.  The optimal parameters of the \GLG
cell model had a fitness score of 4.48 spikes per second.  A normalised metric
that takes into account the different firing rate magnitudes at each sound level
relative to the target response shows a mean absolute difference of 21.5%.

The parameters in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellResults} were within the range of
expected values.  \LSR inputs to the \GLG cell model outweighed \HSR inputs by a
factor greater than 10.  The monotonic response of \LSR fibres at high sound
levels was necessary to create the large dynamic range in the \GLG cell
model. Equally, the \HSR fibres were necessary to provide spontaneous rate
activity at low \SPL.  The spontaneous rate parameter matches the base response
of unit S03-07 in Figure \ref{fig:GolgiResult}. The smoothing filter time
constant of 5 ms is a typical value in membrane time constants for neural models
and fits with the input resistance in intracellular recordings of \GLG cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

The input spread parameter was not well constrained by the optimisation fitness
routine with a pure tone input and a single neuron, but the result was
satisfactory given the uncertainty in \LSR fibres' axonal organisation in the
\GCD.  The dendritic widths in \GLG cells are around 100 \um and the frequency
separation laminae in the \VCN core are approximately 70 \um, giving an expected
spread of 1.5 channels in the 100 channel \CNSM model. Consequently, the optimal
spread parameter of 2.48 channels in the \GLG cell model allowed added frequency
spread from \LSR fibres in the \CNSM model.

** Verification of the Golgi Cell Model

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2} shows the tone and noise rate level responses of
six marginal shell units observed by \citet{GhoshalKim:1996a}.  The unit at the
top of Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}, S03-07 (CF 22.7 kHz), was chosen to
optimise the \GLG cell model as it is monotonic, and has the median maximum rate
of all the units shown.

After setting the optimised parameters in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellResults}, the
\GLG cell model was run with tone and noise inputs to determine its behaviour.
The \GLG cell model was tested across the entire \CNSM model network, using
tones, noise, and tones plus noise stimuli. Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiVerificationPSTH} shows a comparison of \PSTHs to tone bursts
between the optimised \GLG cell model and recorded marginal shell units.  The
\PSTH of the \GLG cell model was classified as unusual and did not contain the
prominent onset responses of the recorded units.  The merging of \LSR profiles
at different \CFs and the convolution of the smoothing filter contributed to the
reduction of the onset response to tones.

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiVerificationWhole} shows the response of optimised \GLG
cell models at each frequency channel in the \CNSM model to a 5.8 kHz tone and
broadband noise over a wide range of sound levels. The \GLG cell model had a
monotonic response to tones and noise similar to other experimental units
\citep{GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a,GhoshalKim:1997}.  In Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiVerificationWhole}A, the rate level response of the central \GLG
unit was generated using the optimised parameters.  Using a sigmoidal function,
the rate level curve had a theoretical spontaneous rate of 0 spikes/s (3.77
spikes/s calculated from 0 to 15 dB SPL), a threshold at 19 dB SPL, and a
dynamic range of 68 dB.  The theoretical maximal rate for the curve was 120.8
spikes/s and the reaches half maximum rate at 53 dB SPL.  The noise rate-level
curve for the central \GLG unit in Figure \ref{fig:GolgiVerificationWhole}B was
monotonic.  The average gradient of the noise rate level curve between 70 and
120 dB SPL was 2.02 spikes/s/dB.  Figure \ref{fig:GolgiVerificationWhole}C shows
the response of all \GLG cell units in the \CNSM model to a 5.8 kHz tone.  At 10
dB above the threshold (30 dB SPL) units with CFs from 4.98 kHz to 7.48 kHz were
above threshold, which equates to a receptive field of 2.5 kHz or \Qten of 0.41.
The GLG unit with CF 6.43 kHz had the highest rate at 30 dB SPL and was closest
to the middle of activated units in the network.  The range of activated units
was 4.6 kHz at 50 dB SPL (~30 dB thresh) and 10 kHz for 80 dB SPL.  Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiVerificationWhole}D shows the noise rate level response of all GLG
units. The non-uniform response to a linear broadband input reflects the species
specific audiogram compression in the AN model.

** Discussion of the Golgi Cell Model

The \GLG cell model reproduces the monotonic rate-level response observed in
experimental data of a single unit in the marginal shell of the VCN
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997} to a high degree of accuracy.  Moderately-driven,
monotonic behaviour was found in a majority of recorded units /in vivo/
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. A simple classic type 1 current clamp neural model
(Type 1c \RM model), similar to the /in vitro/ recordings by
\citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, was the first choice for the GLG cell model.
The lack of evidence surrounding the distribution of \ANFs, particularly \HSR
fibres, in the region of the \GCD and the limited physiological data led to
using a filter-based neural model for the \GLG cell. This model is
computationally faster without minimising the physiological output of the model.

The evidence surrounding non-auditory excitatory inputs to the \GLG cell were
not included as this was not relevant to a strong sensory-driven input and the
role of the \CNSM model is to recreate acoustically-driven outputs.  Inhibitory
synapses are known contact Golgi cells is a number of mammalian species
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,Cant:1993}.  Inhibitory inputs to the GLG cell
model, such as other \GLG cells or \DS cells, were excluded due to limited
experimental data and the additional problems this would add to the sequential
optimisation process.  

Given these limitations and the results of the optimisation, the GLG cell model using the novel
filter-based neural model is sufficient to proceed with the optimisation of the
\DS cell network parameters.

# Optimisation Using Click Recovery and Rate Level Responses 

The next section introduces the major wide-band onset inhibitor of the \CNSM
model, the \DS cell.

** Background

In the mammalian \CN, \DS cells have a wide ranging influence on almost all
primary cells of the \CN.  Glycinergic terminals of the \DS cell contact \TS and
bushy neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983}, and fusiform and \TV
neurons in the ipsilateral \DCN (Type II and Type IV \EIRA units). Some \DS
cells exit the \CN, forming commissural connections with the contralateral \CN
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007}.  /In vitro/ studies have shown that \DS cells are
strongly inhibited by the neurotransmitter GABA, predominantly at \GABAa
receptor synapses \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  \GLG cells are the only
\GABA-ergic neuron in the VCN, but their axonal plexus does not extend into the
magnocellular core. \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997} found that all \DS cells labelled
with BDA staining in the \DCN had dendritic projections that entered the \GCD,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:DSinGCD}.

# All DS cells, labeled by \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997}, had dendritic
# processes extending into the granule cell domain. Large multipolar VCN
# neurons, DS cells, are known to have dendritic projections into the
# GCD, the location of GABAergic \GLG cells.

This section identifies network parameters and intrinsic cell properties that
influence the behaviour of \DS cells.  In the first optimisation, Section
\ref{sec:Ch3:DSClickRecovery}, click recovery responses are used to optimise the
\GABAa synapse of the \DS model.  In the second optimisation, Section
\ref{sec:Ch3:DSRateLevel}, rate-level responses to tones and noise are used to
optimise the parameters controlling level of \ANF excitation in the \DS model.

# Large multipolar or stellate cells in the \VCN have been shown to have 3--4
# long dendrites stretching 200 microns (or one third of the \VCN) and their
# axonal collaterals cover the same region in the \VCN, almost one half of the
# \DCN, and are one source of the commissural projection to the contralateral
# cochlear nucleus \citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007}.

*** Morphology of D Stellate Cells

# \DS cells are large multipolar neurons in the \VCN and have an \OnC \PSTH to
# tones and noise \citep{SmithRhode:1989,NeedhamPaolini:2006}.

Morphologically, DS cells typically have 3--4 long dendrites stretching one
third of the \VCN and receiving \ANF inputs over a wide frequency range.  \DS
cell axon terminals contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine and synapse
with a fast acting receptor \GlyR with other cells in the \CN
\citep{MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2004,RubioJuiz:2004,Alibardi:2003a,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002,PiechottaWethEtAl:2001,MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2000,DoucetRossEtAl:1999,HartyManis:1998,HartyManis:1996}.
Their axonal collaterals cover the same region in the \VCN, and almost one half
of the \DCN
\citep{Cant:1992,Cant:1981,SchofieldCant:1996,CantBenson:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2007,PaoliniClark:1999}.
They also send a commissural projection to the contralateral \CN that mediates
fast inhibition between the nuclei
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2006,Oertel:1997}.
\citet{SmithMassieEtAl:2005} combined evidence from studies in different animals
to suggest that radiate neurons in rats, large Type II multipolar neurons in
cats and guinea pigs, and DS neurons in mice have the closest resemblance to
glycinergic labeled neurons and physiologically classified \OnC and \OnL units
\citep[see~also~][]{DoucetRossEtAl:1999,DoucetRyugo:1997,CantGaston:1982,Wenthold:1987,KolstonOsenEtAl:1992,AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993,ShoreGodfreyEtAl:1992,SchofieldCant:1996,Alibardi:2000a,NeedhamPaolini:2003,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PaoliniClark:1999}.
# Hereafter they will be termed \DS cells in the \CNSM model.
# Intracellular responses to sounds indicate the bandwidth of inputs to
# \DS neurons typically ranges from two octaves below \CF to one octave
# above \CF
# \citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PaoliniClark:1999}.

Figure \ref{fig:DSOertelFujino} shows the depolarising and hyperpolarising
responses of DS cells /in vitro/ in mice
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,FujinoOertel:2001}.  Depolarising currents produce
regular \APs with double-exponential undershoots. Weak depolarisation produces
an action potential at the onset of the stimulus (Figure
\ref{fig:DSOertelFujino}A).  Hyperpolarising current responses show strong
inward rectification with rapid return to stable levels (time constants under 15
ms). In this way, \DS cells are different from the slowly integrating TS cells
which are Type I current clamp units with single exponential undershoot \APs and
less prominent hyperpolarising sag.

*** Acoustic Properties of D Stellate Cells

\DS cells have been classified as having an \OnC\space \PSTH to \CF tones across
many species
\citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983,BlackburnSachs:1989,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,Pfeiffer:1966,SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PaoliniClark:1999,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}.
Their high threshold to \CF tones and increased response to noise show \DS cells
receive inputs from many weak \ANFs across a wide frequency range
\citep{RhodeSmith:1986,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.  Electrophysiological
intracellular responses /in vivo/ to sounds indicate that the bandwidth of \ANF
inputs to \DS neurons is asymmetric, with an estimated range of two octaves
below the \DS cells' \CF and one octave above \CF
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.


Post-onset GABAergic inhibition in \DS cells is a major influence on the \PSTH
of \OnC neurons \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  Iontopheroretic
investigations /in vivo/ using bicuculine
# (a \GABAa blocker) 
# by Caspary and colleagues \citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994} have
have shown that the firing rate increases to tones and noise
\citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994}.
# The \GABA effects on \OnC units'
# response area are predominantly on \CF.  
Application of bicuculine in the \VCN has the effect of changing the temporal
behaviour in \DS cells \citep{EvansZhao:1998}, which also affects \AM responses
in the \IC \citep{CasparyHelfertEtAl:1997,CasparyPalombiEtAl:2002}.  With click
pairs, \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997} showed strong \GABA inhibition does not
allow full click recovery in onset choppers until 16 ms separation of the probe
and mask clicks.

** Implementation



# 2.5. Data analysis Data were collected as spike times with a
# resolution of 10 μs and analyzed off-line on a micro-VAX 3100
# (Digital). Response histograms were plotted and analyzed using a
# windowing technique in which spike counts were taken over brief time
# windows of identical duration for the masker and probe components
# (Fig. 1B). Using the control conditions, counting windows were
# determined individually for each unit but ranged between 1 and 4 ms
# based on the control response to the masker alone and the probe
# alone. To assess response variability over time, repeated unmasked
# controls for both the masker (masker alone, Ma) and probe (probe
# alone, Pa) were obtained during the pre-drug, drug, and post-drug
# recovery conditions. Drug doses were determined empirically as the
# lowest dose that elicited a reproducible and reversible effect. To
# allow normalization of the masked probe response obtained in the
# paired-click paradigm to the unmasked response obtained when the probe
# was presented alone, identical measurement windows were used in the
# control and drug conditions for a given unit. The suppression recovery
# functions for each unit were normalized by taking the ratio Pm/Pa
# where Pm is the masked probe spike count and Pa is the unmasked
# response to the probe (Fig. 1C).


The \DS neural model was implemented with a single-compartment, Type I-II \RM
model \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The Type I-II \RM model is unique to \DS cells
due to the presence of low-threshold potassium currents. The Type I-II model was
chosen so that at high levels of intracellular current injection the model
produces a regular firing pattern, whereas near threshold the model responds
with a spike at the onset of the stimulus. A larger cell body diameter, average
25 \um \citep{SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, was included in the model
and conductance parameters were adjusted accordingly to keep total-compartment
conductance the same as the original values \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.
Synaptic inputs to the \DS cell model come from from \ANFs (\HSR and \LSR
fibres) and \GLG cells.  The \CNSM model assumes that \GABA-ergic input to \DS
cells was only from local, acoustically-driven Golgi cells. Other synpatic
inputs to \DS cells are ignored in the \CNSM model.


In order to specify how \ANF and \GABA-ergic inputs regulate the rate and
temporal behaviour of \DS cells, two optimisation routines were performed.  The
temporal response of \GLG cells to \AM is unknown, therefore clicks, as used in
\citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, were deemed the most suitable for optimisation.
The first optimisation, Section [[Results%20of%20Click%20Recovery%20Optimisation][Results of Click Recovery Optimisation]], used the
mask recovery response to click pairs observed in \OnC units
\citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}.  The click pair optimisation tested the \DS
cell model's response with and without GABA-ergic inputs, simulating the
presence of \GABAa antagonists.  The second optimisation, Section [[Results of
Rate Level Optimisation]], used rate level responses to tones and noise from
extracellular recordings of \DS cells \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}. Using
tones and noise at many sound levels helped to optimise the parameters
controlling the level of \ANF excitation in the \DS cell model.

#+LaTeX:\input{../SimpleResponsesChapter/DSRecoveryTable}

Key elements in the creation of the \DS cell model are shown in the Nordlie
Table \ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}A.  A Type I-II single compartment neuron by
\citet{RothmanManis:2003b} has the characteristics of an onset chopper unit and
has previously been used to simulate a \DS cell model.  The selection of a large
multipolar neuron without dendrites was based on computational efficiency and
the need to ensure that the model fitted within the criteria for \DS cells.  \DS
cells have electrotonic dendrites and the filtering in \DS cells controls the
height of excitatory \PSPs reaching the soma
\citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994}. Accordingly, a single compartment with graded
weights was sufficient for the \DS cell model.



The synaptic connections onto the \DS cell model, shown in Table
\ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}C, were simplified to excitatory \ANF inputs (\HSR
and \LSR) and \GABA-ergic input from \GLG cells in the \GCD.  The \DS cell
model's input parameters were pre-emptively fixed.  These included the number of
\GLG to \DS synapses ($\nGLGDS = 25$), the spread of \ANFs to \DS cells
(\sANFDSh and \sANFDSl), and the conduction delay from the \AN (\dANFDS).  The
\ANF spread onto \DS cells is well documented
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
# The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the nucleus
# \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and in physiological studies the
# response area of \DS cell was approximately 1 octave above \CF and 2
# octaves below the \CF \citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
Due to the large computational task of calculating an optimisation routine for
\DS cell input bandwidth across the whole network, the spread of \ANF to \DS
cells was set using a Gaussian distribution with spread below (\sANFDSl=5) and
spread above \CF (\sANFDSl=2.5). This approach assumed average octave separation
between channels of 0.4 octaves, approximating the calculated response area
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999}.


The physiological effect of GABAergic inputs on onset choppers is primarily on
\CF, but the bandwidth is difficult to ascertain
\citep{CasparyHaveyEtAl:1979,PalombiCaspary:1992,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,CasparyPalombi:1993,CasparyPalombiEtAl:1993}.
The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the nucleus (approximately 3
octaves of tonotopic frequencies) and occasionally project into the \GCD
\citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.  \GLG cells' axonal collaterals are confined to
200 \um in the \GCD.
#   # # and \ANF tonotopic organisation in the \GCD is less defined.
The \GLG to \DS cell model connection within the \CNSM model was set to a spread
of 2 channels (i.e.\space SD= $\sqrt{2}$) with zero offset, which corresponds to
a \DS cell receiving synapses from \GLG cell models in a narrow range of
frequency channels.


The additional delay parameter for \ANF terminals on the \DS cell model,
\dANFDS, was shown in Section \ref{sec:Ch3:Delays}. The first spike latency in high
\CF \DS cells ($2.8 \pm 0.09$ ms) is precise and faster than other stellate
neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmith:1986}.  The additional delay of 1.2 ms
from \ANF to \DS input connections is a product of axonal conductance and
dendritic delay.

In order to specify how \GLG cells regulate the click recovery response in DS
cells, a parameter optimisation routine was performed using data from
\citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}.  Table \ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}E describes
the fitness function stimulus as six pairs of masker-probe clicks separated by
50 ms.  Spike outputs of the \DS cell model were recorded in 2 ms windows
following the clicks accounting for the effective minimum \FSL in \DS cells
(consistent with the experimental design of \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}).
Figure \ref{fig:ClickExample} shows the first two click pairs of the fitness
function stimulus and recording method of the \DS cell model's output.

The six parameters to be fit by the routine were the weights of the \HSR\space
\ANFs, \LSR\space \ANFs and \GLG cell model synapses on \DS cells (\wHSRDS,
\wLSRDS, \wGLGDS); the \GABAa synapse fast and slow decay constants ($\tau_{\rm
GABA-1}$, $\tau_{\rm GABA-2}$); and the \DS cell maximum leak conductance
(\gleak).  Initial optimisation procedures were not successful at constraining
the short delay recovery responses (2, 3, 4 ms), so the \DS cells' \Ileak
conductance parameter was included in the optimised parameters to allow the \DS
cell model's input resistance to fit fast-acting behaviour in the cell.


Figure \ref{fig:BackoffPalombi} shows the click recovery response of unit
G61.U6, an AVCN \OnC unit (CF 5.69, Th 30 dB SPL)
\citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}.  The \DS cell model used in the optimisation
had a CF of 5.8 kHz (channel no. 50).  Spontaneous activity in idle periods was
used for additional weighted penalty measures of spontaneous activity and to
restrict over-excitation by \ANFs.


# \PSTHs of the spiking output of \DS units were generated from 25 stimulus
# repetitions. Each response to a click was measured for a period of 2 ms.  The
# sample period was delayed by 4 ms, an estimate of the auditory delay and
# minimum first spike latency for the DS unit.  The unit used in the
# optimisation had a CF = 5.8 kHz (channel no. 50).  Spontaneous activity in
# idle periods was used for additional weighted penalty measures of spontaneous
# activity and to restrict over-excitation by \ANFs.

# Parameters for \GLG cell inputs to \DS cells were optimised based on
# experimental click recovery data from \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, as
# shown in Figure \ref{fig:BackoffPalombi}.  The input stimulus presented a
# series of masker-probe clicks, with intervals of 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16 ms,
# separated by 50 ms.  Although the experimental stimuli was presented every 250
# ms, the optimisation stimulus needed to be computationally efficient so the
# separation was shortened and the sequence reordered to obtain the best click
# recovery response in the \DS and \GLG cells.  The stimulus was repeated 25
# times and a PSTH was produced from the DS cells' spikes.  Spike counts for 2
# ms after the probe and masker click were selected (accounting for the the
# minimum first spike latency for the unit) to calculate a recovery ratio.  The
# \DS cell optimisation function calculated the mean squared error between the
# test model and the experimental data recovery ratios to 5 click pairs.

Rate level curves to \CF tones and noise have been used as a physiological
measure of neurons in the auditory system since the earliest experiments
\citep{RoseGalambosEtAl:1959,SachsYoung:1978}.  Rate level curves are used to
determine the threshold, dynamic range and saturation rate in response to
acoustic stimuli.  The dynamic range of DS cells (\OnC and \OnL units) is much
larger than their primary afferent inputs (DS \gt 50 dB SPL, ANFs \lt 25 dB SPL)
\citep{Joris:1998,Rhode:1994,RhodeSmith:1986}. Figure \ref{fig:ArnottExamples}
shows two \OnC unit rate level responses to \CF tones and broadband noise
\citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.  Both units have higher acoustic thresholds to
broadband noise than pure tones and higher maximum rate to broadband noise.
Unit 284, from Figure \ref{fig:ArnottExamples}A, was used as the target data to
fit the \DS cell model.

Table \ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}F describes the DS cell model rate-level
optimisation routine. Weight and number parameters for the three input
connections to \DS cells were modified in the procedure.  Figure
\ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult} shows the output rate level responses of the input
and \DS cell model using the best fit parameters in Table
\ref{tab:DSRateLevelResults}.  Figures \ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult}A and C show
the rate level responses of inputs \HSR and \LSR \ANFs and \GLG cells, used
during the optimisation.

# \yellownote{TODO: More discussion about parameters. Ratelevel results reaffirm click recovery optimisation}
The \ANF weight parameters show a clear favouritism toward the \LSR input over
\HSR fibres, but the \HSR synapses outnumber the \LSR synapses by a ratio of
2:1.  The best parameters produced a combined RMS error of 61.89 spikes per
second; for non-zero target data elements the mean error relative to the target
was 89\%.

# While this may not seem ideal for fast coincidence detection, the
# large number of \HSR synapses makes up for the small weight that was

The output of the \DS cell model in the optimisation was strongly determined by
its input responses, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult} A and C.
\HSR fibres (all with \SR=50 spikes/s ) have low threshold to sounds and
saturate at moderate sound levels, as shown by the stable rate level responses
to tones and noise (orange circles in Figure \ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult}). These
flat responses at a high rate (approximately 250 spikes/s) were not able to

** Verification of the DS Cell Model



The optimised parameters for inputs to the \DS cell model were applied to \DS
cells across the whole network using tones, noise and tones plus noise stimuli.
The behaviour of an individual \DS cell model output is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:DSverificationPSTH}.  

Figure \ref{fig:DSverificationPSTH}A and B shows
the response of the central \DS cell model (CF=5.8 kHz).
# The onset PSTH
# monotonic responses to tones and noise were similar to other Ghoshal and Kim
# units (Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}).  

Figure \ref{fig:DSverification}C shows the wide response of all \DS units in the
network to a 5.8 kHz tone for increasing sound level.  Adding masking noise
increased the width of the activity across the CF of the central unit (Figure
\ref{fig:DSverification}D), highlighting the broad inputs of \ANFs onto \DS
cells.

# ArnottWalacePalmer A wealth of circumstantial evidence suggests that onset

# cells (Ferragamo et al. 1998).

# ArnottWalacePalmer Either way, it seems likely the On-C cells are in- volved
# in the first binaural interaction underlying absolute sound localization of
# elevation and azimuth using spectral cues. They are apparently not involved in
# the azimuthal discrimination between two sound sources as this has a different
# mechanism (May 2000).

# PaoliniClarke99 In conclusion, these neurons may not only be responsible for
# detecting the onset of acoustic stimuli but may also be responsible for
# processing frequency and intensity features contained within an acoustic
# stimulus. The initial compo- nent is consistent with auditory nerve
# excitation, whereas the drop to sustained levels seen after the initial
# excitation may be a result of feedforward or shunting inhibition that
# predominates above CF. The interplay between excitatory and inhibitory
# influences may underlie the processing by these OC neurons.

# :  Optimisation Using Tone and Noise Rate Level Responses  
The following section introduces, defines and optimises the neural model of \TV cells of the \DCN.

** Background

# Alibardi:2003 In layer 3 of the DCN, glycinergic vertical neurons are present,
# and they have specific nuclear and synaptic characteristics that distinguish
# them from Golgi-stellate cells present in the same layer (Saint-Marie et
# al. 1991; Wickesber & Oertel, 1993; Alibardi, 1999b, 2000a). Vertical (or
# tuberculo-ventral) neurons form a local circuit that connects the dorsal to
# the ventral cochlear nuclei, and also contact the basal dendrites of pyramidal
# cells (Saint-Marie et al. 1991, 1993; Wickesberg & Oertel, 1993; Ferragamo et
# al. 1998).


# Tuberculoventral neurons in the deep layer of the \DCN provide a delayed,
# frequency-specific glycinergic inhibition to TS and DS cells in the \VCN
# \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1988}.  The dendrites of TV cells are
# aligned with \ANFs and indicating narrow frequency tuning. TV cells have low
# spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs; “pauser,” “chopper,” or
# “onset/sustained” have been recorded
# \citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
# response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are
# non-monotonic functions of intensity.

# Anterograde labelling in the \DCN suggests glycinergic Tuberculoventral cells
# project tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-\CF, but also to the adjacent
# low and high frequency side bands in the \AVCN
# \citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004}.  Ultra-structural
# labelling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggest \TV cells are inhibited by DS
# cells and from sources in the \DCN but excitatory inputs were not found from
# TS cells \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.  Intracellular responses from labeled TV
# cells in the mouse show clear excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse
# inhibitory input from DS cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.

*** Morphology and Cellular Properties of Tuberculoventral Cells

\TV cells are glycinergic, inhibitory cells found in the deep layers of the
\DCN. They form local synaptic circuits with pyramidal cells and also send axon
collaterals to the \VCN. The dendrites of \TV cells are aligned with \ANFs;
consequently, they are also known as `vertical' cells, and are tuned similarly
to \ANFs \citep{Rhode:1999}.  \TV cells are characterised as having unique cell
bodies and synaptic characteristics that distinguish them from other cells in
the deep layer, namely Giant cells and Golgi-stellate cells
\citep{SaintBensonEtAl:1991,WickesbergOertel:1993,Alibardi:2000b,Alibardi:1999}.

\TV cells receive weak mono-synaptic excitatory input, mainly on their
dendrites, from \ANFs \citep{OertelWu:1989,ZhangOertel:1993b}.  The
intracellular response of \TV cells to injected currents are linear,
regularly-spaced \APs, indicating \TV cells are simple integrators
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}. The input resistance of \TV cells ranges from 80 to
125 M\Omega \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,Manis:1990}.
# the low spontaneous
# rates and high sound thresholds of Type II \DCN units might be caused by
# a high intrinsic electrical threshold \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997};
# this is consistent with the responses of vertical cells to intracellular
# current injection \citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.


Anterograde labeling in the \DCN suggests \TV cells project tonotopically to the
\VCN not just on-CF, but also to the low and high frequency side bands
\citep{MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.  Three types of
ventro-tubercular units in rats were identified with retrograde labelling in the
\DCN \citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}, compared with only two types in cats
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.  These units are identified as \TS
and \DS cells, with the third in rats identified as small adendritic neurons.


Ultra-structural labeling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggests that \TV cells
are inhibited by glycinergic \DS cells and from sources in the \DCN
\citep{Rubio:2005}.  Intracellular responses from labeled \TV cells in the mouse
show clear diffuse inhibitory input from \DS cells
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1993}.  Evidence in the mouse suggests
also \TV cells also receive excitation from \TS cells
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1993}; however, \citet{Rubio:2005} found no \TS
terminals on rat \TV cells.
  
*** Acoustic Response of Tuberculoventral Cells

\TV cells have low spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs (pauser, chopper,
wide-chopper or onset/sustained) have been recorded
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999}.  The complex
physiological characteristics of \DCN neurons are categorised into \EIRA groups
\citep{EvansNelson:1973,YoungBrownell:1976}.  Type I \EIRA units reflect the
responses of single \ANFs. \TV cells have a non-monotonic response to tones with
increasing sound level, respond poorly to broadband noise, and are categorised
as Type II \EIRA units
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}. Units with Type
II \EIRA responses are sharply tuned have thresholds 10 dB higher than other
units with which they are intermingled and do not respond to broad-band noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungBrownell:1976,Young:1980,SachsYoung:1980,YoungVoigt:1982,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1990,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,Rhode:1999}.
Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1} shows the recording of a single \TV cell, with
narrow tuning and weak response to noise \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.
# \TV cells are characterized as having a non-monotonic response to tones with
# increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband noise
# \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}, as shown in
# Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1}.  Young and his colleagues have shown that most
# neurons in the deep DCN respond to sound with either of two major types of
# response maps, type II or Type IV
# \citep{EvansNelson:1973,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1980,VoigtYoung:1990,Young:1980,YoungBrownell:1976}.

# Responses of tuberculoventral neurons to sound
Recorded \PSTHs of \TV cells /in vivo/ are variable (pause-build, unusual
chopper, or onset with sustained activity)
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  Recordings /in vitro/ show that
\TV cells respond with regular chopper-like \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.  The
strong input from \DS cells across behaviour to voltage-clamped current
injection frequencies contributes little or no response to wide band noise and
firing rates to \CF tones that are non-monotonic functions of intensity.  The
low \SR and high sound thresholds of Type II \DCN units might be caused by a
high intrinsic electrical threshold \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}; this is
consistent with the responses of \TV cells to intracellular current injection
\citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.


Pharmacological effects of neurotransmitter blockers have shown that \TV cells
(Type II \DCN units) are strongly regulated by glycinergic and GABA-ergic
inputs. \TV cells' zero spontaneous activity is still maintained on application
of glycinergic or \GABAa blockers \citep{DavisYoung:2000}.
# \citet{HancockDavisEtAl:1997} suggests their high input resistance
In reponse to sounds, strychnine and bicuculine enable \TV cells to respond more
vigorously to noise and lower the threshold for tones \citep{DavisYoung:2000}.


Taken together with histological studies, the results suggest that \ANFs
(predominantly \LSR fibres) form the major excitatory input to Type II \DCN
units along with other excitation from TS cells.
# If true, this hypothesis could also explain the finding that Type II
# DCN units have consistently higher thresholds than \DCN principal
# cells \citep{YoungBrownell:1976} because \LSR fibres
# \citep{Liberman:1978}.  However, patterns of also have elevated
# thresholds relative to the lowest threshold auditory nerve innervation
# of the \DCN are most consistent with \HSR fibre innervation of \TV
# cell somata and \LSR fibre innervation of dendrites
# \citep{Liberman:1993}.  In that case,
Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the \VCN
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but the role of Type II terminals in the \VCN is
less clear.  Three hypotheses have been proposed.  \citet{WickesbergOertel:1990}
suggest that the role of Type II units in spectral processing may be that of a
delayed narrowband inhibitor in the \VCN, with important echo-suppression
characteristics.  \citet{PaoliniClark:1998} argue that this projection modulates
the response thresholds of \VCN neurons.  \citet{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} propose
that the responses of \DCN principal cells are strongly inhibited by this
narrowband source, especially at sharp spectral peaks close to their \BF.

*** Modelling of Tuberculoventral cells




# \citet{ArleKim:1991a} were the first to show Type II \EIRA units with
#   simple McCullock-Pitts point neuron models of the \DCN.
#   (From Hancock Davis Voigt 97) Blum et al. (1995) used a wideband
#   inhibitory mechanism to create Type II unit responses in a model of
#   the DCN.  In that model, each cell population was described by a
#   mathematical formula for its steady-state rate-level function. This
#   level of abstraction was used to focus specifically on the role of
#   network connectivity in determining the steady-state behaviourof
#   DCNunits. The level of abstraction employed in our model allows for
#   examination of temporal response properties including PST histograms
#   and cross-correlation analysis.
#   \citep{DunnVetterEtAl:1996} performed some modelling.
#   Most recent models from \citep{LomakinDavis:2008} and \citep{ReissYoung:2005}

Modelling of Type II units in the \DCN has been thoroughly investigated by Davis
and colleagues
\citep{YoungDavis:2002,HancockDavisEtAl:2001,DavisYoung:2000,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,DavisVoigt:1996,DavisVoigt:1994,DavisVoigt:1991}.
To create a neural model with low spontaneous rate requires either increasing
the intrinsic spiking threshold or lowering the synaptic strength of the inputs.
Intracellular observations in decerebrate gerbils show higher thresholds in Type
II units \citep{DingVoigt:1997} and intracellularly recorded Type II units.
Another explanation for the absence of spontaneous activity, is the greater
prevalence of \LSR \ANFs as compared with \HSR fibres.  It is yet to be
confirmed whether \LSR fibres preference the deep layers of the \CN
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

# - \citep{Rhode:1999} Vertical cells in gerbils (mainly Type III)

The intrinsic mechanism is more favourable in Type II units, provided there is
sufficient inhibition and excitation \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}. Consistent
with previous \TV cell models \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}, the \CNSM model
used the wide-band inhibition of \DS cells onto \TV cells.  Studies of the
circuitry of the \DCN have shown that wide-band inhibition is necessary for
accurate modeling of the principal cells of the \DCN including Type II units
\citep{ReedBlum:1995,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReed:1998}.  The most
recent \TV cell models have focused on refining the Davis model of the \DCN
circuit \citep{ReissYoung:2005,LomakinDavis:2008}.

** Implementation


The implementation of the \TV cell model used in the \CNSM model and its
optimisation routines are described in Table \ref{tab:TVModelSummary}.  The \TV
cell model was implemented with a single-compartment conductance neural model of
Type I-c, a classic regular firing unit \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The
synaptic inputs to the \TV cell model included excitation from \HSR and \LSR
\ANFs, and inhibition from \DS cells. The weights (\wLSRTV, \wHSRTV) and number
(\nLSRTV, \nHSRTV) of \ANF synapses were used in the optimisation procedures to
allow for coarse and fine adjustments to the strength of excitation. The TV cell
model received \ANF inputs from only one frequency channel at the same CF
(\sANFTV=0).  The strength of inhibition in the \TV cell model was controlled by
the weight and number of \DS cell inputs (\wDSTV, \nDSTV). These parameters were
included in the rate level optimisation. The parameters controlling the
distribution of \DS cell inputs to \TV cells were fixed (\sDSTV=3, \oDSTV=0) in
the rate level optimisation and are the focus of the next section of this
chapter, Section \ref{sec:Ch3:DSTV}.  The reversal potential of TV cells (\Erev)
was also optimised to allow modulation of the level of the resting membrane
potential from the default Type I \RM neural model.

** Results of Tone and Noise Rate Level Optimisation

Figure \ref{fig:TVRateLevelResult} shows the best fitted output behaviour of the
optimised TV cell model (Table \ref{tab:TVRateLevelFig8B}) and its inputs to
target data from the unit in Figure 8A in \citet{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} (see
Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig8}). The target unit had an elevated threshold to noise
relative to \BF tones and no change in threshold when strychnine was applied.
The optimised TV cell model was able to emulate this response in tones but not
in noise (Figure \ref{fig:TVRateLevelResult}D).

The optimised parameters for inputs to the \TV cell model were applied to \TV
units across 100 frequency channels (the whole \CNSM model) and their responses
to tones, noise and tones plus noise stimuli were recorded.  Unlike the \GLG
cell model, the rate-level response of TV cells is non-linear and the noise
rate-level is strongly inhibited (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A).  This is
typical of the Type II \EIRA units in the deep layer of the \DCN
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999}.  The PSTH response of the central \TV
unit (CF=5.8 kHz) at 90 dB \SPL is a simple chopping response, characteristic of
the Type I-c \RM neural model (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A)
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The minimum first spikes occur at 4.3 ms after the
stimulus onset (similar to the un-optimised \TV model's mean \FSL in Section
[[Synaptic Delays]]).

Due to the strong \DS inhibition, the peak \FSL of the optimised \TV cell model
was delayed to 6.5 ms for a 50 dB SPL tone (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}A). In response to loud noise, the onset spike and the
chopping behaviour is suppressed (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}B).
# The \TV model outputs' behaviour is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TVverification},
# similar to the \GLG cell model Figure \ref{fig:Golgiverification}.
Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A and B show the response of the central \TV
model (CF=5.8 kHz). The PSTH in Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}B is a wide
chopper, generated from regular firing Type I-c \RM neural model and the strong
onset inhibition from DS cells. Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}C shows the wide
response of all \TV units in the network to a 5.8 kHz tone with increasing sound
level.  The masked response curves (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}D) show the
wide-band inhibition particularly for tones above \CF. The responses of all \TV
units to pure tones replicate the single channel excitatory inputs from \ANFs
and wide-band inhibition from \DS units (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}C and
D).

# of Wide-band Inhibition onto TV Cells Using Notch Noise Responses


\TV cell model notch noise optimisation.  The main purpose of this optimisation
Table \ref{tab:TVNotchModelSummary} shows the implementation methods used in the
was to test whether \DS cell connection distribution variables (i.e.\space
spread and offset) play a role in modifying the output of \TV cells (as
suggested by \citet{ReissYoung:2005}).
# The experimental data used in the fitness function, from
# \citet{ReissYoung:2005} recorded from individual \TV neurons, is
# adapted for a range of \TV cell models using a single notch stimulus.
The experimental data in Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9} shows the average
responses of Type II \DCN units to notch sweeps \citep{ReissYoung:2005}.  The
optimisation routine would be prohibitive if it used multiple notch sweeps
simulated using a single neuron.  To avoid this outcome, the optimisation used a
single notch presented across the whole network of \TV cells.  Accordingly, the
fitness function took the relative position of cells in the network into account
when comparing the experimental data.  For example, when presented with a notch
noise filtered between 5 kHz and 10 kHz, a unit with \CF of 5 kHz will see a
falling edge of a 1 octave notch, whereas a unit with \CF of 10 kHz will see a
rising edge of a half octave notch.  Figure \ref{fig:TVNotchDiagram} shows the
combination of the Type II \DCN unit notch data for 1 octave.

The notch sweep sets used by \citeauthor{ReissYoung:2005} were generated with
logarithmically constant notch widths and notch centre frequencies ranging from
1 octave below to 1 octave above \CF in $1/50$ octave steps. The single notch
noise stimulus presented in this optimisation routine was generated in
[[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using frozen Gaussian noise (100 kHz sampling rate) and a
Chebyshev Type II band reject filter.[fn:: The \textsf{[[latex:progname][cheby2}]] function is in
the octave-forge signal package and MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox.]  The
sound level in the \citet{ReissYoung:2005} data added further complexity. The
power spectrum was maintained at a constant level per frequency band (dB per
Hz$^{1/2}$) and this was scaled at each point in the notch sweep. For the single
presentation used in this experiment the sound level plays an important part in
stimulating the \ANFs and contributing interneurons. From the previous
optimisation (Section [[Tuberculoventral%20Cell%20Model][Tuberculoventral Cell
Model]]), the preliminary response to noise in \TV cell models was linear
between 40 to 80 dB SPL.


Higher thresholds in Type II \DCN units \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} and the
presence of multiple inhibitory synapses \citep{Alibardi:2006} suggest \TV cells
either receive a strong inhibitory influence or they have a lower \RMP due to a
lower leak current reversal potential. A reduced resting membrane potential may
increase the threshold for excitatory inputs to generate action potentials. To
allow for this, the reversal potential of the TV cell model (\Erev) was used as
a parameter in the optimisation routine with a range from -80 to -50 mV.

The eventual result of the \DS to \TV cell connection optimisation, highlighted
in Table \ref{tab:TVNotchresult}, was derived from simulations using a 70 dB
\SPL notch-noise stimulus.  The optimisation produced a better result for the
offset parameter and the overall error value of the fitness function.  The
offset of \DS onto \TV cells at 2.1 channels, equivalent to a mean of 0.14
octaves (0.34 octaves at the lowest channel and 0.13 at the highest channel),
was closer to the offset predicted by \citet{ReissYoung:2005}.

The results in the \TV cell model notch optimisation show the dominance of \LSR
over \HSR fibres in the number of synapses (29 to 1) and the increased need for
\DS cell inhibition with a high number of synapses, \nDSTV.  \LSR fibres have
not been proven to preference the deep layers of the \DCN
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

** Verification of Notch Sweep Response in the TV Cell Model 

The response of individual Type II \DCN units to notch and band-pass sweeps in
Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9} \citep[from Figure 9 in][]{ReissYoung:2005} was the
target data used for the optimisation of \DS cell connections to \TV cells.  To
replicate the response of a single unit to notch sweeps, notches were generated
in [[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using Chebychev II filters with a sampling rate of 100 kHz
and an optimal filter number.  The half octave sweep was calculated from -2 to 2
octaves away from 12.7 kHz at 1/32$^{nd}$ increments with logarithmically
constant notch widths. A 50 ms stimulus at 50 dB SPL was established in the \AN
model for use by the \CNSM model.[fn:: Logarithmically constant means the notch
width is calculated at the centre frequency of the notch and not the \CF of the
unit of interest.]  Figure \ref{fig:TVSweepUnit70} shows the response of a unit
with similar \CF (\TV unit 70, \CF = 12.76 kHz) to notch and band-pass noise.

# ArnottWalacePalmer The ‘‘V’’- shaped response area of the auditory nerve fibre
# is transformed in the type II neurone by strong inhibi- tion that overlaps at
# high sound levels to generate nonmonotonic responses as a function of sound
# level.  This strong inhibition renders type II neurones in- sensitive to
# broadband signals (Young and Brownell 1976; Young and Voigt 1982; Shofner and
# Young 1985). Type II responses are associated with glycin- ergic ‘‘vertical
# cells’’ located just beneath the fusi- form cell layer in DCN (Rhode 1999).
# Type IV neurones have a response area that is even more restricted, often
# consisting of only an island of excitation severely constrained by inhibitory
# inputs.  Hence, type IV neurones are strongly nonmonotonic as a function of
# tone sound level.  In addition to their type II innervation, which primarily
# influences behavior near the BF, principal cells are also inhibited at
# frequencies far from their BF (Nelken and Young 1994) and are thus subject to
# wideband inhibition, which is antagonized by strych- nine (Davis and Young
# 2000). This wideband inhibi- tion has been postulated to modulate the
# responses of principal neurones both directly, through glycin- ergic
# innervation of these cells, and indirectly, through glycinergic innervation of
# type II DCN interneurones.

# Spirou Abstract
# Young. Spectral integration by type II interneurons in dorsal cochlear
# nucleus. J. Neurophysiol. 82: 648 – 663, 1999. The type II unit is a
# prominent inhibitory interneuron in the dorsal cochlear nucleus
# (DCN), most likely recorded from vertical cells. Type II units are
# characterized by low rates of spontaneous activity, weak responses to
# broadband noise, and vigorous, narrowly tuned responses to tones.
# The weak responses of type II units to broadband stimuli are unusual
# for neurons in the lower auditory system and suggest that these units
# receive strong inhibitory inputs, most likely from onset-C neurons of
# the ventral cochlear nucleus. The question of the definition of type II
# units is considered here; the characteristics listed in the preceding text
# define a homogeneous type II group, but the boundary between this
# group and other low spontaneous rate neurons in DCN (type I/III
# units) is not yet clear. Type II units in decerebrate cats were studied
# using a two-tone paradigm to map inhibitory responses to tones and
# using noisebands of varying width to study the inhibitory processes
# evoked by broadband stimuli. Iontophoresis of bicuculline and strych-
# nine and comparisons of two-tone responses between type II units and
# auditory nerve fibres were used to differentiate inhibitory processes
# occurring near the cell from two-tone suppression in the cochlea. For
# type II units, a significant inhibitory region is always seen with
# two-tone stimuli; the bandwidth of this region corresponds roughly to
# the previously reported excitatory bandwidth of onset-C neurons.
# Bandwidth widening experiments with noisebands show a monotonic
# decline in response as the bandwidth increases; these data are inter-
# preted as revealing strong inhibitory inputs with properties more like
# onset-C neurons than any other response type in the lower auditory
# system. Consistent with these properties, iontophoresis of inhibitory
# antagonists produces a large increase in discharge rate to broadband
# noise, making tone and noise responses nearly equal.


* T Stellate Cell Model: Three Chopper Subtypes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:TSCellModel
:END:

This section reports on the major output neurons in the \CNSM model, \TS cells,
which are classified into three sub-types based on their regular firing or
chopper characteristics.

** Background


A considerable literature exists on the \TS cells of the \VCN
\citep[see~review][]{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  The first extracellular physiology
studies classified supposed \TS cells as regular-firing choppers
\citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1966}.  With further developments in analysis and
classification techniques, \TS cells were segregated into \ChT and \ChS
sub-types % slowly or transiently adapting and sustained chopper sub-types
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  In cats,
\citet{SmithRhode:1989} were the first to perform simultaneous labelling of \TS
cells. They confirmed the physiological response of Type I multipolar neurons as
units classified as choppers.  This simultaneous classification and labelling
was followed by others in gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}, guinea pigs
\citep{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and rats
\citep{PaoliniClarkEtAl:1997,PaoliniClark:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}. In each
of these studies, there were no morphological properties that segregated
transient and sustained choppers, which indicates that synaptic inputs play a
strong role in determining the output of \TS cells.

The technique of averaging intracellular membrane responses to acoustic stimuli
to determine stochastic excitatory and inhibitory inputs was first used in the
chopper units of gerbils \citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}.
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005} used similar averaging of \TS and DS cell
intracellular responses in rats as the basis for a thorough statistical analysis
to separate chopper units into three distinct subtypes.  Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} shows the intracellular acoustic classification of chopper
units in the rat into three types \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}: \ChS chopper
sustained, and two transient choppers, \ChTone and \ChTtwo.  The intracellular
traces in Figure \ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} along with the \CV statistics in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata} formed the basis for the optimisation routine of the \TS
cell model of each chopper type in the \CNSM model.

#  The work by Karina Needham, Tony Paolini, Janine Clarey, 
# and others at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital were pivotal in
# collecting the T stellate cell experimental data used in this
# section.

# In the optimisation of \TS cells 

The categorisation of TS cells via \CV is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata}.  Sustained choppers maintain a stable CV below 0.2
throughout the entire stimulus. The transient chopper optimisation had two types
defined by \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The first transient chopper type,
\ChTone, is categorised with \CV starting below 0.2 then rising, hence the name
transient, but stays below 0.3.  The second transient type, \ChTtwo, is regular
in the first 10 ms period, but rises to 0.3 or higher throughout the stimulus.

*** Synaptic Properties

The synaptic inputs to the \TS cell model (as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:microcircuit}) include excitatory inputs from \LSR and \HSR \ANFs;
\GABA-ergic inputs from \GLG cells; and glycinergic inputs from \DS and \TV
cells.  Figure \ref{fig:TSinputs} shows the expected response of a \TS cell to
individual connections from different cells in the \CNSM model.  The membrane
parameters for the single compartment \TS cell model were default except for
sodium conductance, which was set to zero.  In this example, excitation from the
afferent \ANF inputs (\LSR Figure \ref{fig:TSinputs}A and \HSR Figure
\ref{fig:TSinputs}B) show a large depolarisation.  \HSR inputs show a rapid
onset and a slowly adapting depolarisation throughout the remainder of the
stimulus.  \HSR fibres have a spontaneous rate of 50 Hz and recover to the same
rate around 15 ms after the stimulus offset.


Auditory nerve input to \TS cells is on-\CF. This is due to the arrangement of
their dendrites along the same direction. \ANF terminals rarely contact \TS
cells on their soma and are mainly on proximal dendrites
# cats and rodents
\citep{SmithRhode:1989}.  Terminals closer to the site of \AP activation have a
greater influence and are less likely to be shunted by inhibitory terminals
along the dendrite. \citet{JosephsonMorest:1998} found some \ANF terminals at
the axon hillock of \TS cells in chincillas. This would remove the contribution
of the neuron's intrinsic cell membrane properties and other synaptic inputs on
the output of the neuron.  The number of \ANF terminals on \TS cells is small
relative to their multipolar cousin, \DS cells.  An /in vivo/ study in mice
suggested \TS cells receive as few as 5 excitatory inputs
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

The \CNSM model in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit} shows the TS cell model
receives synaptic inputs from all other neurons in the microcircuit.
Glycinergic inputs to \TS cells come from \DS and \TV cells
\citep{OertelWickesberg:1993}.  Using the glycine-receptor blocker strychnine,
\citet{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994} showed the physiological effects of glycine on
the response area are within the frequency receptive field of chopper units.
The distribution of \DS and \TV pre-synaptic cells are assumed to be centred on
the post-synaptic \TS cell.  The timing of glycinergic inputs is important to
controlling the response properties of \TS cells
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2006,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.
The transient potassium current \IKA has been shown to increase the time to
first spike when an inhibitory synapse input precedes an excitatory one
\citep{KanoldManis:2005,KanoldManis:2001}.  \DS cells have a precise onset spike
to load tones and broadband noise and provide fast inhibition that can reach the
\TS cell soma before excitation in off-CF tones \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}.
\TV cells do not have consistent PSTH responses to tones
\citep{Rhode:1999,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} and their location in the \DCN adds
further delay to inhibiting \TS cells \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}.

Figure \ref{fig:TSinputs} omits the non-linear dynamics of the action potential
and the responses of the intrinsic currents in the \RM neural model. The
hyperpolarisation activation of \Ih and \IKA currents due to inhibitory input
are not evident.  \Ih influences the recovery from \AP and modulates the
regularity of the chopping behaviour \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  \IKA is active
at rest and is important in enhancing the first spike response across \TS cells
to an oncoming stimulus \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004,KanoldManis:2005}.

*** Fitness Function

The optimisation fitness function, $F$, of the \TS cell model calculated the
relative error between a combination of average intracellular membrane voltage
measures and spike time statistics against the experimental data given by
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  Spike trains were collected for 25 repetitions
of a 50 ms \CF tone (5 ms ramp) and analysed for \PSTH and inter-spike interval
characteristics \citep{Pfeiffer:1966a,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.
\CV of the inter-spike intervals were calculated over a 10 ms window, beginning
at stimulus onset .  Chopper units were required to have three regular intervals
at the start of the stimulus otherwise the stimulus repetition was excluded from
the \CV calculations.  The \AIV statistics, introduced by
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}, included the onset ratio, adaptation shift and
offset shift.  The \AIV measures highlight the balance of excitation and
inhibition in \TS cells and were designed to be independent of \RMP and
\FSL. The effective stimulus onset was determined as 2.5 ms prior to the peak in
the \AIV trace.

The onset ratio measure was calculated as the ratio in peak onset depolarisation
(sum over the first 5 ms) relative to the sustained depolarisation (sum measured
between 20 to 25 ms).
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:IVstats-Onset} \textrm{Onset Ratio} = \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=0}^{t=5}\quad/\quad \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=20}^{t=25}.
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX


The adaptation shift measurement calculates the drop in depolarisation at the
end of the stimulus compared to the stable point 20 ms after the onset
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:IVstats-Adap} \textrm{Adaptation} = \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=20}^{t=21}\quad - \quad\bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=50}^{t=51}. 
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Greater adaptation to a sustained stimulus is represented by a larger drop in
depolarisation. Adaptation shift is caused by a combination of factors, but is
mostly due to reduced excitation from ANF inputs which is caused by adaptation
at the IHC-AN synapse.

The offset shift measures the effects of sustained inhibition and recovery of
excitation 10 ms after the stimulus offset
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:IVstats-Offset} \textrm{Offset} = \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=-10}^{t=0}\quad - \quad\bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=60}^{t=61}.

Three \CF tone bursts at different \SPL above threshold (20, 30 and 40 dB) were
used in all three \TS cell model optimisations.  The threshold was assumed to be
10 dB SPL and the CF of the unit was 9.1 kHz.  Figure \ref{fig:PaoliniIVdata}
shows the results of the chopper sub-groups for adaptation shift (see Equation
\ref{eq:IVstats-Adap}) and average post-tone hyperpolarisation (see offset shift
Equation \ref{eq:IVstats-Offset}). These data points, along with the CV data
points in Figure \ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata} at 30 db re threshold, were used in the
fitness function as a root mean squared comparison against the \TS cell model.
Population data given by \citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005} was used where
appropriate, otherwise an exemplar unit was chosen to fill remaining data
points.  \ChS unit population data for \AIV results was limited to one data
point at offset shift at 30 dB re threshold ($1.6\pm1.0$ mV).

The unfilled triangles in Figure \ref{fig:PaoliniIVdata} were measured from the
average membrane voltage trace of unit 01-859-013
\citep[Figure~3~in][]{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  Adaptation shift in \ChT1 and
\ChT2 units increased with increasing \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:PaoliniIVdata}A),
reaching a peak at 30 dB above threshold.  \ChTtwo units consistently had a
stronger inhibitory influence (adaptation and offset shifts) compared to \ChTone
for all \SPL above threshold.

*** Sustained Chopper

\glsreset{ChS} 

Figure \ref{fig:CSresults} shows the optimisation results for the \ChS subtype
of the \TS cell model.  The exemplar \ChS unit had a depolarisation threshold at
10 dB and a firing rate saturation at 75 dB \SPL.  The stimulus for the
optimisation routine was a pure tone 30 dB above acoustic threshold at \CF (3.9
kHz 40 dB \SPL), 5 ms on\slash off cosine squared ramp.  A 20 ms delay was
included to allow the model to reach a sustained \RMP. The ChS model unit had CF
of 3.872 kHz due to the separation of frequency channels in the model.  The best
parameters found by the optimisation and shown in Figure \ref{fig:CSresults},
were very high excitatory input (\wLSRTS =
call_opt_param(param="w.x[lsr][ts]",type="CS")[:results replace raw] \uS,
\wHSRTS = call_opt_param(param="w.x[lsr][ts]",type="CS")[:results replace raw]
\uS) and moderate to high inhibition ( \wDSTS =
call_opt_paramf(param="w.x[ds][ts]",type="CS")[:results replace raw] \uS, \wTVTS
= call_opt_paramf(param="w.x[tv][ts]",type="CS")[:results replace raw] \uS,
\wGLGTS = call_opt_paramf(param="w.x[glg][ts]",type="CS")[:results replace raw]
S). The low input stimulus level meant that the majority of synaptic input came
from \HSR fibres.  There was a one-third increase in the leak conductance
(\gleak = call_param_ts_gleak(type="CS")[:results replace raw] \Scmsq ) from the
initial value (4.907e-04 \Scmsq), causing a decrease in the input resistance to
120 M$\Omega$ from 163 M$\Omega$.  The final error, calculated with more weight
on the CV variables, was call_opt_error(type="CS")[:results replace raw].
Post-tone hyperpolarisation (exemplar +1.30 mV, best \ChS model -0.03 mV) and
the first \CV value (exemplar 0.154, best \ChS model 0.497) had the greatest
difference.  The poor initial \CV response was due to the irregular first spike.
The large excitatory \HSR input causes spikes to occur after tone onset, just
before the stimulus-invoked spike arrival at the \TS cell 3 ms later, but was
still included in the \CV calculation.

# \note{TODO: The peaks for the IV are 3.66,
# 6.77, and 10.99 ms. The AN model input is affected by the rat audiogram,
# the low CF and low level.  This shifts the arrival time of spikes to the
# TS model, and a raw IV comparison would need to be shifted by approx 2
# ms. The onset ratio and the first CV value are effected by this.}

# \note{TODO: Synaptic weight in the model above 0.002 will initiate a
# spike at each input spike, similar to the calyx synapse on bushy
# cells. This means that the TS cell will respond with a primary-like or
# primary with notch PSTH. Dendritic filtering could improve this but the
# high synaptic weights do not seem like a realistic physiological option
# for small bouton endings in the CN.}

*** Transient Chopper 1

The optimisation results of \ChTone are shown in Figure \ref{fig:CT1results}
with best parameters as shown in Table \ref{tab:TSCellResults}.  The \ChTone
unit chosen as the exemplar for the optimisation was unit 01-857-007
\citep[CF=8.2~kHz][]{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The depolarisation threshold for
the exemplar unit was 55 dB \SPL, close to the average 47.2 dB \SPL for all
\ChTone units.  The acoustic for the optimisation routine was a 40 dB SPL and
had the reversal potential of $-63.9 mV$.

\wTVTS call_opt_paramf(param="w.x[tv][ts]",type="CT1")[:results replace raw]
\uS).  The GABAergic input weight was very low (\wGLGTS
call_opt_paramf(param="w.x[glg][ts]",type="CT1")[:results replace raw] \uS), but
the loud input stimulus (70 dB SPL = 30 dB re threshold) would cause reasonable
inhibition to the \TS cell throughout the stimulus.

The CV responses of the optimised model were not sufficient at 30 dB re

period of the being outside the 0.3 CV threshold for regularity
(CV$_{30-40}=0.42$).
  
*** Transient Chopper 2

The \ChTtwo unit optimisation used average population data for CV data and unit
01-305-014 (CF 12.4 kHz \citep*{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}) for IV measure
data. The reference unit had a low depolarising threshold (5 dB \SPL) so the
stimulus was set to 35 dB \SPL; a significant difference from the \ChT1
optimisation unit that was optimised using an 85 dB \SPL tone. The main
difference between the transient chopper types is reflected in their \CV values
after 10 ms, with the \ChT2 type becoming irregular (i.e. having a CV value over
0.3) and maintaining that regularity for the remainder of the stimulus.  \ChT2
has a higher reduction in onset depolarization (90.2\%) compared to ChT1, and
post-tone inhibition is greater (+8.82 mV at 30 dB re threshold)
\citep*{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.

Figure \ref{fig:CT2results} shows the results of the \ChTtwo model unit
optimisation.  The resting membrane potential for the experimental and model
\ChTtwo units was $-60.63$ and $-64.96$ mV, respectively.  The experimental
\ChTtwo unit has a higher reduction in onset depolarisation (90.2\%) compared to
\ChTone units, and are comparable with \OnC units
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.

  model, especially the methods.}

The T stellate cells in the \CNSM model form one of the major ascending auditory
  pathways through the brainstem.  It enables a high fidelity sensory input to
  be passed to higher order centres, by reproducing the spectrum in a robust
  fashion \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003} and synchronisation to
  significant periodic frequencies \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

** CNSM Cell Models


** Limitations of the CNSM Model

All \BNN models are limited by a number of factors.  Firstly, the level of
detail in the neural models set the underlying complexity and dynamics that are
possible within the \BNN.  Secondly, the connectivity and synaptic parameters,
which set the network dynamics, are often hand-tuned or guessed. Finally, the
background and driving inputs to the network set the environmental conditions
for genuine realistic models to be compared with experimental animal network
under the same conditions and inputs.

The level of detail in the neural models of the \CNSM model includes the complex
channel dynamics of a \HH conductance model.  Three potassium current channels
(\IKHT, \IKLT, and \IKA) and the mixed cation hyperpolarisation current (\Ih)
were fit precisely from \VCN neurons in mice
\citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}.  More complex
multi-compartment conductance model could have been chosen to include dendritic
filtering, especially in \GLG, \DS and \TV cells.  Ball-and-stick neural models
already existing in stellate models \citep{WangSachs:1995,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}.

The performance of the \CNSM model owes a large part to the input of a
phenomenologically-realistic \AN model.

* Conclusion 

# Figure [[*Optimisation%20Results][Optimisation Results]]

# Example conclusion The purpose for performing the experiments herein
# was to gain insights into the functional relevance of the Type II
# neurons by analyzing their endogenous firing features. The observed
# electrophysiological diversity between the two classes of primary
# auditory neurons argues for different roles for the Type I and II
# neurons. In contrast to the Type I spiral ganglion neurons, the type
# II neurons show markedly distinct kinetics and receive a classically
# convergent innervation pattern that is also present in other sensory
# systems. Like the rod neural circuitry in the retina, the Type II
# spiral ganglion neurons appear to be designed to integrate input
# from the many receptors that they innervate. This would have very
# little impact, however, on signal detection without the process of
# temporal summation. The slow kinetics of the Type II spiral ganglion
# neurons, along with their ability to respond at relatively
# hyperpolarized voltage levels, are features consistent with mechanisms
# designed to detect low-intensity stimuli.

biophysically-realistic model of the stellate microcircuit in the cochlear
nucleus.  The methods used in this section are a practical and realistic means
for constructing microcircuits with sensory or feature-based topography. They
exploit extensive experimental evidence that describes the behaviour of each
interneuron in the network.  The tabular reporting format for neural network
modelling, as suggested by \citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009}, was followed so
that other researchers can easily reproduce this work.


The next chapter investigates the optimised \CNSM model with more the complex,
biologically-realistic stimuli involved in amplitude modulation.
