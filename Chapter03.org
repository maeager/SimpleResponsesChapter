  \small
  To understand brain function, the focus of investigations
  must expand from detailed responses and structure of single cells to
  include unit responses to the activity of other cells, and how these
  responses are distributed over a population of similar cells as
  wells as across populations of different cell types. \\

Shamma calls upon the neuroscience community to investigate the role of
populations of neurons in neurophysiology.  To do so, this chapter draws
on the wealth of experimental data accumulated in auditory neuroscience
to create a detailed \BNN model of the T stellate microcircuit in the
cochlear nucleus (hereafter referred to as the \CNSM model, as described
in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}).  The design and methods for the
construction of the model provide insights relevant to other neural
network models of the brain, especially those that use sensory pathways.

Despite advances in computational neuroscience, it remains a challenging
task to develop an accurate representation of the complex behaviour of
real neural networks.  Choices, guesses and assumptions continue to be
integral parts of neuronal modelling \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}.  With
the acceleration of computational power and enhanced experimental
techniques in multi-unit recordings, it is possible to develop more
detailed neural models. There is much to be gained from
biophysically-realistic modelling approaches, especially in the
thoroughly investigated cochlear nucleus of mammals, bats and birds.

#\yellownote{TODO: think about linking to end of methods chapter.  I.e. reproducbable research}

# \yellownote{TODO: See neural detail in auditory
# system\citep{LuRubioEtAl:2008}} \yellownote{Discuss use of Poisson
# models vs HH-like models.  Discuss single cell simulation vs whole
# network simulation during optimisation.}

To develop and optimise detailed neural models and neural network
models, reproducible research methods are required.  In this chapter,
the table method introduced by 
\citet[as described in Chapter~\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}]{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is used to
summarise the neural models used in each optimisation step.
# The Nordlie tables shown in each optimisation stage consist of A) the
# model summary, B) cell type populations, C) connectivity between two
# cell types, D) neuron and synapse models, and E) optimisation
# parameters.  This method aims to show a consistent and recognisable
# format for presenting various neural network models and their
# constituents.  \yellownote{this needs more explanation in the methods
# sections}
In order to create a realistic microcircuit, the parameter optimisation
routine needs to be developed in sequential stages.  The connections
within the \CNSM model (Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}) were developed
using such a sequential method of optimisation steps.  Parameters in the
microcircuit can be separated into two classes, cell-based and
connectivity-based.  The cell-based parameters for each cell model in
the \CNSM model, discussed in Section [[Neural Cell Models]], remain
relatively fixed. The connectivity-based parameters, introduced in
Section [[Connectivity Parameters]], are the main focus of this chapter.
The parameters in the sequential optimisation stages were chosen so that
they did not influence the properties of previously fitted parameters.
The parameters of each cell type were determined based on experimental
data or were optimised based solely on responses to simple stimuli. Each
cell type was typified with its characteristic \PSTH in response to
short tone bursts
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}, and the
\EIRA to tones across the frequency spectrum \citep{Evans:1992}.  
# The
# process methods for optimisation were described in Section [[Optimisation%20Techniques][Optimisation
# Techniques]].

# These included specifying the model to be optimised,
# the criteria, and the parameters and the constraints of
# the model, and implementing the optimisation.
# The restricted network models optimised in each section are presented in their
# Background sub-section.   
# Criteria to be satisfied are presented in Implementation
# sections by specifying the experimental data set, the stimulus and the
# recorded output analysis required.  Parameters and constraints of the
# model are also presented in the Implementation section and the
# accompanying Nordlie table.  Optimisation results are presented in the
# Results section of each step.

** Cochlear Nucleus Stellate Microcircuit Model 

\glsunset{GABA}

The \CNSM model shown in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit} comprises the following cells:
1. The \HSR and \LSR \ANFs : A phenomenological auditory model provides
   spiking input to \CN neurons across frequencies and spontaneous rate
   types of the \ANFs from an arbitrary input stimulus
   \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  The baseline in Figure
   \ref{fig:microcircuit} is a simplification of \ANFs from low \CF to
   high \CF (left to right). The model reproduces responses for high and
   low \SR \ANFs at 100 channels across the frequency range 200 Hz to 48
   kHz.
2. The \GLG cell: A \GABA-ergic \VCN marginal shell unit that is
   presumed to regulate excitability in the \GCD and core \VCN units
   \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Only one /in vivo/ study has
   recorded extracellular data in the marginal shell area of the \CN
   \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The presumed characteristics of Golgi cells
   are taken from that study and are defined by a monotonic response to
   tones and noise, a Type I\slash III \EIRA, and an unusual or chopper
   \PSTH.
3. The \DS cell: A large, glycinergic, multipolar\slash stellate
   cell with \OnC \space \PSTH response that acts as a coincidence detector.
   Its large dendritic area increases its response to noise, allowing it
   to behave as a wide-band inhibitor in the \VCN, \DCN, and
   contralateral \CN
   \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
4. The \TV cell: A glycinergic, Type II \EIRA unit in the
   deep layer of the \DCN \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  This cell acts
   as a delayed echo-suppressor and narrow-band inhibitor, with
   recurrent connections between D and T stellate cells in the \VCN
   \citep{Alibardi:2006,OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991}.
5. The \TS cell: One of the major output projection cells of the
   \CN to the inferior colliculus and the primary output of the \CNSM
   model.  This multipolar neuron has been shown to have robust spectral
   representation and enhanced synchronisation to modulation in speech
   sounds \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

Optimisation of a detailed \BNN model requires a realistic input model
with which to mimic the behaviour observed in live neural
networks.  In examining the properties of a detailed neural model of the
cochlear nucleus, a realistic and phenomenologically sound auditory
model is needed to represent sounds and transformations that occur in
the central auditory system.  The input to the \CNSM model, the auditory
nerve fibres, is discussed in the next section. To further fit the
parameters of the CN model, a simplistic and sequential method was
applied to each of the cell types using experimental data.


The order of the optimisation routines is important because of the
interdependencies in the iso-frequency microcircuit and across the
whole nucleus.  In the \CNSM model,  Golgi cells only received
inputs from the \ANFs and were the first model and network parameters to be optimised.  \DS cells were modeled next because they received inputs from \ANFs and
\GABA-ergic Golgi cells. The \TV cells' input network
parameters were optimised next as they were strongly inhibited by \DS cells
and received excitation from \ANFs. Input parameters to \TS
cells, which received inputs from all other cell types in the \CNSM model, were
optimised last.  Due to the variety of possible inputs to \TS cells (and the
observed physiological classification sub-types in chopper units), three
\TS cell model sub-types were optimised.

** Auditory Nerve Fibre Model 


The \ANF inputs to the \CNSM model neurons were drawn from the Carney
model, a phenomenological auditory periphery model first presented in
\citet{Carney:1993}.  This chapter also uses more recent derivations of the
Carney model:
the Bruce model
\citep{BruceSachsEtAl:2003,ZilanyBruce:2006,ZilanyBruce:2007} and the
Zilany model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.
#Three \ANF  #the ARLO model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001}, the
# The auditory model consists of an outer\slash middle ear pre-processing
# filter, a cochlea filterbank, IHC-to-AN synapse model and dead-time
# modified Poisson spike generator, as shown in Figure
# \ref{fig:ZilanyBruceFig}.  \citet{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated
# cochlea filters based on the critical bandwidths obtained from
# psychophysical experiments in humans.  The ARLO model of the cat
# auditory periphery, with non-linear compression and two-tone
# suppression, is used in this study except in the vowel simulation where
# the human auditory periphery model is used.

# \yellownote{TODO: 
# AN model paragraph has been changed - fix any comment related to new
# Zilany}

# The \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007} model improves the previous AN model by
# an additional signal path and its predictions have matched a wide
# range of physiological data in normal and impaired cat data. The
# most recent AN model comprises an power-law synapse model, with
# internal $1/f$ noise, that enhances the behaviour of long-term
# dependence in ANFs \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.

# \yellownote{TODO Why is it the cat model? updating Carney model? Updating
#   of the Carney auditory model has led to the change in the model's
#   configuration from an original implementation of the rat model.  The
#   default species is the cat and will be used in the data presented in
#   this chapter.}


# ** Spiking in Poisson Neural Models 

The neural models used in the \ANFs and Golgi cell model were
inhomogeneous Poisson processes.  The instantaneous rate produced the
input \AN model (chosen from the Bruce or Zilany model) or through the
Golgi filter model (Section [[Golgi%20Cell%20Model][Golgi Cell Model]]) was passed through the
Jackson spiking model \citep{Jackson:2003,JacksonCarney:2005}, which
includes refractory effects typical of the \ANFs.  Spike trains for each
neuron in the \AN model were created at the start of each repetition of
the stimulus.  Further details on \HSR and \LSR ANF models are provided
in Section [[High and Low Spontaneous Rate Fibres]].


# Analysis of the frequency
# response area of ANF generates known parameters for each fibre, these are:
# \begin{itemize}
# \item the spontaneous rate (SR), generated in silence and is
#   categorised into two groups High SR (\gt 18 sp/s) and Low SR (\lt 18
#   sp/s);
# \item threshold, the sound pressure level(SPL) at which the cell
#   responds above the spontaneous rate
# \item characteristic frequency (CF)
# \end{itemize}

** Neural Models

Single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-like neural models were used for the
\DS, \TV and \TS cells in the \CNSM model. 
The \RM neural model is a conductance based neural model with membrane current models
 developed by \citet{RothmanManis:2003b}. The \RM model is discussed in detail in Section \ref{sec:Meth:cell-models} in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}.




# Type I-c classic regular firing contains a voltage-activated
# sodium, high threshold potassium, and hyperpolarisation mixed-cation,
# and leak current channels.  This neural model an integrator and is
# strongly influenced by the \Ih current, which is active at rest.  Type
# I-t transient regular firing type is similar to the Type 1 classic but
# with A-type potassium current channels.  A-type potassium channels are
# unique to the cochlear nucleus, particularly to T stellate cells
# \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a}.  \DS cells contain
# low-threshold potassium current channels, which is strongest in bushy
# cells, to enhance response to coincident inputs.

# \yellownote{TODO: Discuss RM model (put in Methods Chapter).  Perhaps expand
#   more on the role of the currents on each neuron in the CN model.}

** Connectivity and Network Parameters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:ConnectivityNetworkParameters
   :END:

Tonotopic connectivity in the \CNSM model was defined by the regular
organisation of afferent \ANFs into distinct iso-frequency channels.
The channels were separated using even spatial distance (based on the
basilar membrane and auditory nerve separation) with centre frequency
calculated by the Greenwood function for the cat
\citep[see~Chapter~\ref{sec:MethodsChapter},][]{Greenwood:1990}.  The
\HSR \ANF terminals of individual fibres generally cover 70 \um and \LSR
fibres cover 100 \um in mice \citep{OertelWuEtAl:1988,OertelWu:1989}.


Figure \ref{fig:CNconn} shows the Gaussian distribution of connections
between cell types in the \CN.  The \CFs of the \CN channels were
separated using the same Greenwood function used for the filterbank of
\AN frequency channels.

** Synapse Models

\glsunset{AMPA}\glsunset{GlyR}

The synaptic models for \AMPA, \GlyR and \GABAa receptors were described
in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter} Section [[sec:Ch2:SynapseModels]].
#\ref{sec:Ch2:Synapse}

** Synaptic Jitter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:Jitter
   :END:

Precise onset cues are a critical feature of the auditory pathway
especially in the localisation of sounds.  In modeling the \CN, onset precision
is essential for enhancing periodic stimuli in TS cells
\citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997} and echo-suppression in \TV cells
\citep{BurckHemmen:2007,WickesbergOertel:1990}.  Stochastic behaviour at
the \IHC-\AN synapse limits the onset encoding performance in the
auditory nerve.  Jitter of the \FSL is commonly measured by the standard
deviation; jitter in \ANFs is 0.73 ms \citep{RhodeOertelEtAl:1983}.  Most units in the VCN exhibit
reduced onset jitter through sampling multiple ANFs, but onset units
like \DS cell have additional morphological and intrinsic specialisations for
greater onset precision.



# Units that encode the precise time of arrival
# would be of utility for such a system in deter-
# mining the sound location. The onset cells en-
# code the start of sound more precisely than
# any other group of neurons in the cochlear
# nucleus. 
# \OC units exhibit a particularly small
# variability in first spike latency between units,
# whereas a given Oc unit also has the smallest
# amount of noise in the time of occurrence of
# the first spike to a series of tone stimuli. The
# standard deviation of the first spike is usually
# between 20 and 50 \mus and
#  it was common to
# have every first spike in an Oc response to 250
# tone pips occurring in a lOO-ps interval. This
# compares with a 730 ps average in the jitter
# of auditory nerve fibers. Other onset units also
# had a much smaller fluctuation in latency than
# auditory fibers. 


To account for \ANF jitter and synapses placed at various distances
along the dendrites of \TS, \DS and \TV cells, a random jitter was
introduced to the AN synaptic delay.  Figure \ref{fig:CSjitter} shows
the effects of jitter on the intracellular responses of a Type I-t \RM
neural model \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}, averaged over 25
repetitions. Jitter was added separately to each \ANF synapse using an
absolute Gaussian distribution random number with standard deviation of
0.1 ms and mean dependant on the cell type (e.g. \dANFTS). The effect of
adding jitter to individual \ANF synapses in the \CNSM model was to
increase the mean and standard deviation of \FSL in \CN neurons. These
effects replicated dendritic delays without the added computational cost
of a passive neural compartment in the model.  Dendritic attenuation of
the \EPSP was not accounted for.

** Synaptic Delay Additional Parameter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:Ch3:Delays
   :END:


The effective delay of the \AN model does not take into account the
conduction and synaptic transmission delay in reaching post-synaptic
neurons in the \CNSM model. Accordingly, an additional delay component
was required in each of the synaptic connections in the \CNSM model
involving \ANFs.  Mean \FSL to short \CF tones and click stimuli were
used to set delay times between \ANFs and \CN cells
\citep{RhodeSmith:1986,RhodeOertelEtAl:1983,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The additional delay was defined using the \FSL of high frequency units
as the sum of the \ANFs' \FSL, \ANF conduction delay, and the synaptic
transmission delay.  The first spike latency measured in high \CF units
in the ARLO \AN model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} for \HSR fibres was
1.5 ms.


Table \ref{tab:Meth:AddDelay} shows the additional delay component for
each cell type, calculated from population statistics, to ensure the
first spike latency in the models matched the experimental data.  The
models were designated from the basic \RM neural models
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The relative difference between the \DS
cell model's mean \FSL and the other Type I cell types can be attributed
to the additional \IKLT channels in the Type I-II \RM neural model.
\IKLT is active at \RMP and decreases the overall input resistance and
membrane time constant, reducing the time to fire an action potential.
\TS cells are designated with the Type I-t \RM model, which contains an
additional \IKA channel current over the Type I-c model, but were not
significantly different from the classic Type I models in \TV and Golgi
cell models.

** Optimisation Routine

The optimisation routine used in this chapter was NEURON's [[latex:progname][fit\_praxis]]
function, which uses the principle axis algorithm
\citep[PRAXIS,~][]{Brent:1976}. The PRAXIS method returns the minimum of
the fitness function of /n/ variables using the principal axis
method without the use of function's gradient.
The fitness function converts the parameters to a single measure by simulating the \CNSM model using the parameters, then comparing selected neural outputs to experimental data.
\RMS error is generally used as the comparison measure of similar data points, for example mean firing rate at different sound levels in a rate-level simulation.
Mean error relative to the expected or target values is also used to ensure there is no bias between data points with large variation in differences.

** Verification of Cell Model Responses to Simple Tones and Noise

To verify the optimisation processes, a suite of tests were run across
the whole \CNSM model.  The purpose of these simulations was to ensure
the optimised parameters could be used across all frequency channels.
These simulations aimed to show the behaviour of a \CNSM model neuron at
the centre of the network to tones corresponding to its \CF, broad-band
noise and a combination of tones and noise. Responses of all model
neurons across the network (one cell type for each frequency channel)
were recorded during the verification procedure.  The stimuli presented
to the \CNSM model included:
1. Rate-level response to pure tones at the characteristic frequency
   of the centre channel of the network, 5.81 kHz. The sound level was
   varied from 0 to 90 dB SPL.
2. Rate-level response to white noise at levels 0 to 100 dB SPL.
3. Masked rate-level response with pure tones varied in level from 0
   to 100 dB SPL and simultaneous withe noise at 50 dB SPL.
  

The next part of this chapter introduces the specific attributes of the Golgi cell model in the \CNSM model.

** Background

# GLG Cell Model
*** Morphology of Golgi Cells

Golgi cells can be distinguished from the numerous smaller granule cells
in the \GCD by their larger cell body and surrounding plexus of
dendritic and axonal neurites. The soma diameter of Golgi cells is
approximately 15 \um \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, while the
diameter of granule cells is 8 \um in cats \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}
and 6 \um in rats and mice \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,Alibardi:2003}.
Smooth, tapering dendrites, between 50 and 100 \um long, emanate in all
directions
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Cant:1993,MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}.  A
dense, axonal plexus, limited to the plane of the granule cell domain,
extends approximately 250 \um from the soma in all directions
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,BensonBrown:2004}.

# In layer 2 of the DCN Alibardi rat (9–15 \um) GABA-ergic cells round cell body
# surrounded by small granule cells immuno-negative to Glycine and GABA.

The dendrites of \VCN Golgi cells are mitochondria-rich and make
glomeruli complexes with long synaptic junctions with the mossy fibre
boutons \citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980}. The somata generally have few
boutons of flat or pleomorphic vesicle type, characteristic of
glycinergic and GABAergic terminals. Along with inhibitory boutons, the
dendrites also receive excitatory input with large (Type I \ANF) and
small (Type II \ANF and granule cell) vesicles
\citep{MugnainiOsenEtAl:1980,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998,Ryugo:2008}.
#  \citep{Alibardi:2003} In non-tonotopic circuits integration between acoustic
# and non-acoustic inputs occurs \citep{RyugoWrigthEtAl:1993}.
The contribution of the circuits of granule cell areas of the cochlear
nucleus to the processing of the acoustic signal is poorly understood;
for a review of non-auditory inputs to GCD see
\citet{OhlroggeDoucetEtAl:2001}.

# # from Mugnaini This paper describes the fine structure of granule cells and
# granule-associated interneurons (termed Golgi cells) in the cochlear nuclei of
# cat, rat and mouse.  Granule cells and Golgi cells are present in defined
# regions of ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei collectively termed "cochlear
# granule cell domain'. The granule cells are small neurons with two or three
# short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with terminal
# expansions. These participate in glomerular synaptic arrays similar to those
# of the cerebellar cortex. In the glomeruli the dendrites form short Type 1
# synapses with a large, centrally-located mossy bouton containing round
# synaptic vesicles and Type 2 synapses with peripherally located, smaller
# boutons containing pleomorphic vesicles. The granule cell axons is thin and
# beaded and, on its way to the molecular layer of the \DCN, takes a straight
# course, which in ventral nucleus is parallel to the pial surface. Neurons of
# the second category resemble cerebellar Golgi cells and occur everywhere
# interspersed among the granule cells. They are usually larger than the granule
# cells and give rise to dendrites which may branch close to and curve around
# the cell body. The dendrites contain numerous mitochondria and are laden with
# thin appendages, giving them a hairy appearance.  Both the cell body and the
# stem dendrites participate in glomerular synaptic arrays.  Golgi cell
# glomeruli are distinguishable from the granule cell glomeruli by unique
# features of the dendritic profiles and by longer, Type 1 synaptic junctions
# with the central mossy bouton.  The Golgi cell axon forms a beaded plexus
# close to the parent cell body. The synaptic vesicle population of the mossy
# boutons suggests that they are a heterogeneous group and may have multiple
# origins.  Apparently, each of the various classes participates in both granule
# and Golgi cell glomeruli.  The smaller peripheral boutons with pleomorphic
# vesicles in the two types of glomeruli may represent Golgi cell axons which
# make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell axons
# which make synaptic contacts with both granule and Golgi cells. The Golgi cell
# dendrites, on the other hand, are also contacted by small boutons en passant
# with round synaptic vesicles, which may represent granule cell axons. A
# tentative scheme of the circuitry in the cochlear granule cell domain is
# presented. The similarity with the cerebellar granule cell layer is striking.

*** Cellular Mechanisms of Golgi Cells

In a single study in mice, intracellular recordings of Golgi cells
showed a classic repetitively-firing response to current clamp and an
inward rectifying response to voltage clamp
\citep[][Figure~\ref{fig:GolgiIV}]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.  Golgi
cells are classified as Type I current-clamp neurons and act as simple
integrators of synaptic input \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
# Their intrinsic properties suggests Golgi cells are simple integrators.
Response to AN shocks in Golgi cells were found to be delayed by
approximately 0.7 ms relative to the core \VCN units, with minimum delay
in most cells around 1.3 ms \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

*** Acoustic Response of Golgi cells

# The physiological response of Golgi cells has not been extensively studied.

Extracellular recordings from labelled Golgi cells are not available in
the literature; however, electrophysiological studies of the \GCD (or
marginal shell of the \VCN in cats) have been done without direct
labelling of recorded units
\citep{Ghoshal:1997,GhoshalKim:1997,GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a}.
Any extracellular spikes recorded in the \GCD are most likely from Golgi
cells since granule cell somata are less than 10 \um and their narrow
axons are unlikely to elicit electrical activity in the electrodes
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

## Change this sentence
# There was a substantial presence of

Strongly driven units in the anterior \VCN shell exhibit non-saturating
rate-level functions to pure tones, noise or both with dynamic ranges as
wide as 89 dB \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The majority of \GCD units
recorded by \citet{GhoshalKim:1997} were classified as Type I\slash III
or III \EIRA units, showing a monotonic increase in firing rate with
increasing sound intensity to tones and noise.  Some units showed Type
II or Type IV \EIRA properties. One unit was classified as Type II due
to its poor response to noise but it did not show a reduction of
response to tones at high \SPL, typical of \DCN Type II units
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. Two units with low \CF (\lt 1.5 kHz) were
classified as Type II \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.  The \PSTH of the units
included wide chopper, onset-chopper (\OnC), and pause-build; however,
nearly one third of units did not fit into the known classifications and
were called "unusual" \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.

The latency of acoustically driven \GCD recorded units ranges from 2.4
ms to over 10 ms, with a mean of 3.75 ms.  The acoustic latency closely
matches the minimum latency of \EPSPs to AN shocks recorded in mice /in vitro/ preparations \citep[1.3~ms,][]{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
Longer latencies (greater than 10 ms) may be due to Type II \ANFs,
estimated theoretical latency of 10 ms \citep{Brown:1993}, or from
polysynaptic excitation by granule cells.

The assumed functional role of Golgi cells is to regulate granule cells
but they may also provide automatic gain control to the principal \VCN
units, primarily D and T stellate cells
\citep{GhoshalKim:1997,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

\yellownote{first sentence too long and could go at start of Golgi section}


The presence of GABAergic inputs to \VCN and \DCN neurons has been
verified by labeled terminals adjacent to the soma and dendrites
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,AwatramaniTurecekEtAl:2005,BabalianRyugoEtAl:2003}
and release from inhibition in their response areas with
ionotopopheretic application of the \GABAa antagonist, bicuculine
\citep{EvansZhao:1998,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
The source of GABAergic inputs to cells in the mammalian \CN is somewhat
contentious.  Studies show that GABAergic inputs to the \CN generally
arise in the peri-olivary regions of the medulla in cats
\citep{OstapoffBensonEtAl:1997} and birds
\citep{LachicaRubsamenEtAl:1995,YangMonsivaisEtAl:1999}.  Slice
preparations of the isolated murine \VCN show strong and immediate
sensitivity to bicuculine in T and D stellate cells from a source within
the \CN complex \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  The only known
source of \GABA intrinsic to the \VCN is the Golgi cells of the \GCD
overlying the \VCN \citep{Mugnaini:1985,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

Inputs to Golgi cells are more complicated than the inputs to core \VCN
neurons.  Golgi cells are sparse in the \GCD, surrounded by the many
smaller excitatory granule cells that form small en-passant endings.
Type II \ANFs create diffuse glutamatergic release sites in the \GCD
\citep{HurdHutsonEtAl:1999,BensonBrown:2004} that may stimulate NMDA
glutamate receptors in Golgi cells \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.

** Implementation

The key attributes of the Golgi cell used to inform the creation of the
\GLG cell model were as follows:
 1. Golgi cells are classic integrator neurons, as shown by 
    their Type I current clamp response \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
 2. The minimum \EPSP in Golgi cells to an electric shock of the AN
    \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998} and mean first spike latency to
    acoustic stimuli \citep{GhoshalKim:1997} are significantly different
    from the core \VCN units.
 3. Golgi cells have a low maximum rate and large dynamic range to tone
    and noise stimuli \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}.
 4. The low threshold in Golgi cells can\-not be solely due to \LSR
    fibre inputs that have high thresholds \citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. This
    suggests medium and high spontaneous rate Type I ANFs or Type II
    (that project to the \GCD) may provide weak inputs to Golgi cells.
    The lack of extensive experimental data regarding Type II \ANF units
    and granule cell response to acoustic input, reward an inhomogeneous
    Poisson rate neural model over the Hodgkin-Huxley type neural model
    in the Golgi cell used in the \CNSM model.  Although \HSR \ANF
    terminals do not generally project into the \GCD, they were included
    in the \CNSM model to provide some low level spontaneous activity.

The Golgi cell model was implemented as an instantaneous-rate Poisson
rate model, as shown in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}D and in
Figure \ref{fig:GolgiDiagram}.  The primary inputs were from the \HSR and \LSR \ANF
model's instantaneous rate outputs with connections across frequency
channels.  The strength of \HSR and \LSR \ANF inputs to Golgi cells was
determined by a Gaussian distribution in units of channel separation in
the network.  The weight vectors, $\mathbf{w}_{\HSRGLG}$ and
$\mathbf{w}_{\LSRGLG}$, span the \CNSM model's channels with size
\Nchannels, with a normal curve centred on the position in the
channel and variance \sANFGLG\@.  For example, for \LSR inputs to Golgi
cells, at position /i/ in the frequency channels, the weight vector was
modified by the weight parameter \wLSRGLG, and the spread parameter
\sLSRGLG, which is the variance in a standard Gaussian function
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
\label{eq:GolgiWeights}
\mathbf{w}_{\LSRGLG} (i,x)= \wLSRGLG \frac{1}{\sqrt(2\,\pi\,\sLSRGLG))} \exp\left(\frac{-(x-i)^2}{2 \sLSRGLG}\right),
  \end{equation} 
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $x=1,\ldots,\Nchannels$.

The intermediate step in the Golgi cell model, $g_i(t)$, combines the
weighted sum of \HSR and \LSR instantaneous-rate and corrects the output
rate for the desired spontaneous activity, \Gspon, and is given by
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:GolgiInputSum}
  \textrm{g}_i(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{\Nchannels}{\mathbf{w}_{\LSRGLG}(j) {\rm LSR}_j(t) + \mathbf{w}_{\HSRGLG}(j) {\rm HSR}_j(t)}  - \textrm{\Gspon}.
  \end{equation} 
#+END_LaTeX
The length of the instantaneous rate profiles of \HSR and \LSR models
(and consequently \GLG models) were determined by the stimulus duration
and sampling rate ($N_{\rm stim}$ = stimulus duration / sampling
rate). Profiles were calculated for each channel in the network
(size=\Nchannels) and stored for use during repeated simulations.

The weighted sum of \HSR and \LSR instantaneous-rate vectors were
convolved with a smoothing kernel, mimicking synaptic and dendritic
properties of the Golgi cell model. The smoothing kernel is an alpha
function, $\alpha_{\rm GLG }(t)$, given by
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GolgiAlpha}
  \alpha_{\rm GLG}(t) =  t\, \exp\left(\frac{-t}{\Gtau}\right). 
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The smoothing kernel was normalised by setting the area under the
function to 1. For a large enough filter length, the alpha function
integral
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
\int \alpha(t) dt = (-\Gtau^2 - t\,\Gtau) \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\Gtau}\right)
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent equals $\Gtau^2$ as /t/ approaches infinity.
# In this case $10 \times \Gtau$ is used for the filter duration.  
The convolution of the weighted inputs, /g/ with
normalised smoothing kernel,
# #+BEGIN_LaTeX
#   \begin{equation}
#   \label{eq:GolgiConvolutionA}
#   \textrm{GLG}_{i}(t) = \overline{{\alpha}_{\rm GLG}} \ast g_{i}.

used a discrete convolution method and was cropped to the length of the
input stimulus,
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:GolgiConvolution}
  \textrm{GLG}_{i}(t) =\sum_{u=0}^{u=N_{\alpha}} \frac{1}{\Gtau^2} \alpha_{\textrm{GLG}}(u)  g_{i}(t-u),
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $N_\alpha=10\,\mathsf{dt}\,\Gtau$ is the length of the
smoothing kernel and $\mathsf{dt}=0.05$ is the time step of the \ANF
input rate vectors.  The inhomogeneous Poisson spiking model with
refractory effects \citep[as used for the \ANF models][]{Jackson:2004}
was used to generate the output spike times for the Golgi cell model.

Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary} shows the model summary used to
optimise the Golgi cell model.  As explained in the Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}, Section [[Optimisation Techniques]],
# \ref{sec:Ch2:Optimisation},
the Nordlie tables are used to communicate detailed neural models and
networks for further replication by the computational neuroscience
community.  The topology of the \VCN follows the same tonotopic
organisation of the \AN, with 100 evenly-spaced frequency channels.  As
Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}B shows, the ANFs were not required
because only the instantaneous profiles of each \AN frequency channel
were used in the Golgi model.  In the \CNSM model, the connectivity
between \ANFs and Golgi cells (Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}C)
was a simple place-based Gaussian spread, as explained in Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter} (Section [[Connectivity%20and%20Topology%20in%20Neural%20Microcircuits][Connectivity and Topology in Neural
Microcircuits]]).


The experimental data used to optimise the Golgi cell model was the rate
level response of the marginal shell unit shown in Figure
\ref{fig:GhoshalKim97_Fig2}.  This unit was chosen due to its monotonic
response to pure BF tones and its moderate maximal firing rate (100
spikes per second). The closest frequency channel (channel 76,
CF=22.7kHz) to the experimental unit's CF (21 kHz) was used for the GLG
cell model. The fitness function for the GLG cell model optimisation
used 22.7 kHz pure tones at 22 sound levels to compare the experimental
and model units. The GLG cell model parameters used in the optimisation
are shown in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}E.

** Optimisation Results

## COMMENT OUT UNUSED FIGURE AND TEXT
# Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult} shows the output of the test
# optimisation trials for the Golgi cell model.  The testing trial used
# only five sound levels (0, 15, 55, 75 and 85 dB \SPL) and detected the
# mean rate from the instantaneous profile in its fitting routine.  The
# best response obtained a minimum root mean squared error of 11.63
# spikes/sec against the five points in the target experimental data of
# unit S03-07  \citep[CF~21~kHz][]{GhoshalKim:1996a}.  A rate-level
# curve (green circles, Figure \ref{fig:GolgiTestResult}) was generated
# from the spiking output to show the discrepancy in the
# spike-based rate-level and the monotonic rate based rate-level.  The
# lack of low level response and a higher threshold indicated the need
# for some \HSR input into the Golgi cell model.

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiResult} shows the rate-level output of the Golgi
cell model with its optimal combination of parameters as shown in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellModelSummary}E.  Twenty two sound levels from -15 dB
SPL to 90 dB SPL were used in the fitness function to compare the Golgi
cell model (CF=22.7 kHz) with the experimental unit S03-07
\citep[CF=21~kHz,][]{GhoshalKim:1996a} representing the target response.
The mean firing rate, generated from 25 repetitions at each level, was
used in the fitness function to produce a square root of the mean
squared difference between the model response and the target response.
The optimal parameters of the Golgi cell model had a fitness score of
4.48 spikes per second.  A normalised metric that takes into account the
different firing rate magnitudes at each sound level relative to the
target response shows a mean absolute difference of 21.5%.

The parameters in Table \ref{tab:GolgiCellResults} were within the range
of expected values.  \LSR inputs to the Golgi cell model outweighed \HSR
inputs by a factor greater than 10.  The monotonic response of \LSR
fibres at high sound levels was necessary to create the large dynamic
range in the Golgi cell model. Equally, the \HSR fibres were necessary
to provide spontaneous rate activity at low \SPL.  The spontaneous rate
parameter matches the base response of unit S03-07 in Figure
\ref{fig:GolgiResult}.  The smoothing filter time constant of 5 ms is a
typical value in membrane time constants for neural models and fits with
the input resistance in intracellular recordings of Golgi cells
\citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.

The input spread parameter was not well constrained by the optimisation
fitness routine with a pure tone input and a single neuron, but the
result was satisfactory given the uncertainty in \LSR fibres' axonal
organisation in the \GCD.  The dendritic widths in Golgi cells are
around 100 \um and the frequency separation laminae in the \VCN core
is approximately 70 \um, giving an expected spread of 1.5 channels in the 100 channel \CNSM model. Consequently, the optimal spread parameter of 2.48 channels in the \GLG cell model allowed added frequency spread from \LSR fibres in the \CNSM model.

** Verification of the Golgi Cell Model

Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2} shows the tone and noise rate level responses of 6 marginal shell units observed by \citet{GhoshalKim:1996a}.  The unit at the top of Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}, S03-07 (CF 22.7 kHz), was chosen to optimise the \GLG cell model as it is monotonic, and has the median maximum rate of all the units shown.

After setting the optimised parameters in Table
\ref{tab:GolgiCellResults}, the \GLG cell model was run with tone and
noise inputs to determine its behaviour outside of the optimisation
routine.  The \GLG cell model was tested across the entire \CNSM model
network, using tones, noise, and tones plus noise stimuli. Figures
\ref{fig:GolgiVerificationPSTH} and \ref{fig:GolgiVerificationWhole}
show the response of an optimised \GLG cell model at the centre of the
network (CF=5.8 kHz) and had monotonic responses to tones and noise
similar to other experimental units
\citep{GhoshalKim:1996,GhoshalKim:1996a,GhoshalKim:1997}.


Figure \ref{fig:GolgiVerification}C shows the response of all Golgi
units in the network to a 5.8 kHz tone, over 0 to 90 dB \SPL.

** Background

\glsreset{DS} 

In the mammalian \CN, \DS cells have a wide ranging influence on almost
all primary cells of the \CN.  Glycinergic terminals of the \DS cell
contact \TS and bushy neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983},
and fusiform and \TV neurons in the ipsilateral \DCN (Type II and Type
IV \EIRA units). Some \DS cells exit the \CN, forming the commissural
connection with the contralateral \CN \citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007}.  /In
vitro/ studies have shown that \DS cells are strongly inhibited by the
neurotransmitter GABA \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.  Golgi cells
are the only GABAergic neuron in the VCN, but their axonal plexus does
not extend into the magnocellular core. \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997} found
that all DS cells labelled with BDA staining in the DCN had dendritic
projections that entered the \GCD, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:DSinGCD}.

# All DS cells, labeled by \citet{DoucetRyugo:1997}, had dendritic
# processes extending into the granule cell domain. Large multipolar VCN
# neurons, DS cells, are known to have dendritic projections into the
# GCD, the location of GABAergic Golgi cells.

# Large multipolar or stellate cells in the \VCN have been shown to have 3--4
# long dendrites stretching 200 microns (or one third of the \VCN) and their
# axonal collaterals cover the same region in the \VCN, almost one half of the
# \DCN, and are one source of the commissural projection to the contralateral
# cochlear nucleus \citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Copied from original jneurometh article
*** Morphology of D Stellate Cells

#\DS cells are large multipolar neurons in the \VCN and have an \OnC
#\PSTH to tones and noise \citep{SmithRhode:1989,NeedhamPaolini:2006}.

Morphologically, DS cells typically have 3--4 long dendrites stretching
200 \um (or one third of the \VCN) and receiving \ANF inputs over a
wide frequency range.  \DS cell axon terminals contain the inhibitory
neurotransmitter glycine and synapse with a fast acting receptor \GlyR
with other cells in the \CN
\citep{MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2004,RubioJuiz:2004,Alibardi:2003a,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002,PiechottaWethEtAl:2001,MahendrasingamWallamEtAl:2000,DoucetRossEtAl:1999,HartyManis:1998,HartyManis:1996}.
Their axonal collaterals cover the same region in the \VCN, and almost one
half of the \DCN
\citep{Cant:1992,Cant:1981,SchofieldCant:1996,CantBenson:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2007,PaoliniClark:1999}.
They also send a commissural projection to the contralateral \CN  that mediates fast inhibition between the nuclei
\citep{NeedhamPaolini:2003,NeedhamPaolini:2006,Oertel:1997}.
\citet{SmithMassieEtAl:2005} combined evidence from studies in different
animals to suggest that radiate neurons in rats, large Type II
multipolar neurons in cats and guinea pigs, and DS neurons in mice have
the closest resemblance to glycinergic labeled neurons and
physiologically classified \OnC and \OnL units
\citep[see~also~][]{DoucetRossEtAl:1999,DoucetRyugo:1997,CantGaston:1982,Wenthold:1987,KolstonOsenEtAl:1992,AltschulerJuizEtAl:1993,ShoreGodfreyEtAl:1992,SchofieldCant:1996,Alibardi:2000a,NeedhamPaolini:2003,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PaoliniClark:1999}.
#Hereafter they will be termed \DS cells in the \CNSM model.
# Intracellular responses to sounds indicate the bandwidth of inputs to
# \DS neurons typically ranges from two octaves below \CF to one octave
# above \CF
# \citep{PalmerJiangEtAl:1996,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PaoliniClark:1999}.

# Double expon. Undershoot (Paolini and Clark 1999; Wu and Oertel 1984)
#
# Type I-II have high thresholds probably mediated by small ILT (Rothman
# and Manis 2003c); Membrane properties of Oc cell have not bee
# adequately characterised, bu the information that is available (d
# stellate in mouse (Oertel et al. 1990)) suggests that the
# low-threshold potassium channel that is important in extending the

Figure \ref{fig:DS_OertelFujino} shows the depolarising and
hyperpolarising responses of DS cells /in vitro/ in mice
\citep{OertelWuEtAl:1990,FujinoOertel:2001}.  Depolarising currents
produce regular \APs with double-exponential undershoots. Weak
depolarisation produces an action potential at the onset of the stimulus
(Figure \ref{fig:DS_OertelFujino}A).  Hyperpolarising current responses
show strong inward rectification with rapid return to stable levels
(time constants under 15 ms). In this way, \DS cells are different from
the slowly integrating TS cells which are Type I current clamp units
with single exponential undershoot \APs and less prominent
hyperpolarising sag.

The \DS neural model in the \CNSM model was implemented with a
single-compartment, Type I-II \RM model \citep{RothmanManis:2003b},
which included small traces of \IKLT current.  The Type I-II \RM model
has one or two \APs in response to a small depolarising current pulse
but a regular discharge of APs in response to a larger depolarising
current pulse.

*** Acoustic Properties of D Stellate Cells

\DS cells have been classified as having an \OnC\space \PSTH to \CF
tones across many species
\citep{RhodeSmithEtAl:1983,BlackburnSachs:1989,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,Pfeiffer:1966,SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PaoliniClark:1999,SmithMassieEtAl:2005}.
Their high threshold to \CF tones and increased response to noise show
\DS cells receive inputs from many weak \ANFs across a wide frequency
range \citep{RhodeSmith:1986,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003}.
Electrophysiological intracellular responses /in vivo/ to sounds
indicate that the bandwidth of \ANF inputs to \DS neurons is asymmetric,
with an estimated range of two octaves below the \DS cells' \CF and one
octave above \CF
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.

Post-onset GABAergic inhibition in \DS cells is a major influence on the
\PSTH of \OnC neurons \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}.
Iontopheroretic investigations /in vivo/ using bicuculine 
# (a \GABAa blocker) 
#by Caspary and colleagues \citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994} have
have shown the firing rate increases to tones and noise
\citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994}. The \GABA effects on \OnC units'
response area are predominantly on \CF.  Application of bicuculine in
the \VCN has the effect of changing the temporal behaviour in \DS cells
\citep{EvansZhao:1998}, which also affects \AM responses in the \IC
\citep{CasparyHelfertEtAl:1997,CasparyPalombiEtAl:2002}.  With click
pairs, \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997} showed strong \GABA inhibition
does not allow full click recovery in onset choppers until 16 ms
separation of the probe and mask clicks.

The \CNSM model assumed that \GABA-ergic input to \DS cells was only from
local, acoustically-driven Golgi cells.  The temporal response of Golgi
cells to \AM is unknown, therefore clicks and click pairs, as used in
\citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, were deemed the most suitable for
optimisation.

# Latency of excitation to auditory nerve
# shocks suggests Golgi cells are activated by Type II \ANFs and low
# spontaneous rate Type I \ANFs
# \citep{BensonBerglundEtAl:1996,FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
#   Therefore,
# Type II and \LSR Type I \ANFs could be involved in gain control through
# GABAergic modulation of activity in the \VCN.


# AM coding effects of GABA in the Chinchilla
# \CN \citep{BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999}. \citep{CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994}
# Caspary and colleagues worked on the effects of \GABA in in the \VCN.
# Zhang and Winter looked at the response area of \VCN onset units to
# determine \GABA {on\slash off} freq.  Smith and Rhode, Smith and
# others looked at OnC response area and two-tone

** Implementation

This section describes the setting of network parameters and the
intrinsic cell properties that influenced the behaviour of the \DS cell
model.  In the first optimisation, Section [[Results of Click Recovery
Optimisation]], click recovery responses were used to optimise the \GABAa
synapse and inputs to the \DS model.  In the second optimisation,
Section [[Results of Rate Level Optimisation]], rate-level responses to
tones and noise were used to optimise the parameters controlling
excitation in the \DS model.


# 2.5. Data analysis Data were collected as spike times with a
# resolution of 10 μs and analysed off-line on a micro-VAX 3100
# (Digital). Response histograms were plotted and analysed using a
# windowing technique in which spike counts were taken over brief time
# windows of identical duration for the masker and probe components
# (Fig. 1B). Using the control conditions, counting windows were
# determined individually for each unit but ranged between 1 and 4 ms
# based on the control response to the masker alone and the probe
# alone. To assess response variability over time, repeated unmasked
# controls for both the masker (masker alone, Ma) and probe (probe
# alone, Pa) were obtained during the pre-drug, drug, and post-drug
# recovery conditions. Drug doses were determined empirically as the
# lowest dose that elicited a reproducible and reversible effect. To
# allow normalisation of the masked probe response obtained in the
# paired-click paradigm to the unmasked response obtained when the probe
# was presented alone, identical measurement windows were used in the
# control and drug conditions for a given unit. The suppression recovery
# functions for each unit were normalised by taking the ratio Pm/Pa
# where Pm is the masked probe spike count and Pa is the unmasked
# response to the probe (Fig. 1C).


The \DS neural model was implemented with a single-compartment, Type
I-II \RM model \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The Type I-II \RM model is
unique to \DS cells due to the presence of low-threshold potassium
currents. The Type I-II model was chosen so that at high levels of
intracellular current injection the model produces a regular firing
pattern, whereas near threshold the model responds with a spike at the
onset of the stimulus. A larger cell body diameter, average 25 \um
\citep{SmithRhode:1989,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, was included in the
model and conductance parameters were adjusted accordingly to keep
total-compartment conductance the same as the original values
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.



In order to specify how \ANF and \GABA-ergic inputs regulate the rate
and temporal behaviour of \DS cells, two optimisation routines were
performed.  The first optimisation used the click recovery observed in
\OnC units \citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, with and without GABA, to
investigate the temporal behaviour of the \DS cell model.
The second optimisation used rate level responses to tones and noise from extracellular recordings of \DS cells
\citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.

Key elements in the creation of the \DS cell model are shown in
the Nordlie Table \ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}A.  A Type I-II single
compartment neuron by \citet{RothmanManis:2003b} has the characteristics
of an onset chopper unit and has previously been used to simulate a \DS
cell model.  The selection of a large multipolar neuron without
dendrites was based on computational efficiency and the need to ensure that the
model fitted within the criteria for \DS cells.  \DS cells have
electrotonic dendrites and the filtering in \DS cells controls
the height of excitatory \PSPs reaching the soma
\citep{WhiteYoungEtAl:1994}. Accordingly, a single compartment with
graded weights was sufficient for the \DS cell model.

#+LaTeX:\input{../SimpleResponsesChapter/DSRecoveryTable}


The synaptic connections onto the \DS cell model, shown in Table
\ref{tab:DScellModelSummary}C, were simplified to excitatory \ANF inputs
(\HSR and \LSR) and \GABA-ergic input from Golgi cells in the \GCD.  The
\DS cell model's input parameters were pre-emptively fixed.  These
included the number of Golgi to \DS synapses ($\nGLGDS = 25$), the
spread of \ANFs to \DS cells (\sANFDSh and \sANFDSl), and the conduction
delay from the \AN (\dANFDS).  The \ANF spread onto \DS cells
is well documented
\citep{PaoliniClark:1999,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,JiangPalmerEtAl:1996,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
# The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the nucleus
# \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and in physiological studies the
# response area of \DS cell was approximately 1 octave above \CF and 2
# octaves below the \CF \citep{PaoliniClark:1999,PalmerJiangEtAl:1996}.
Due to the large computational task of calculating an optimisation
routine for \DS cell input bandwidth across the whole network,  the spread of
\ANF to \DS cells was set using a Gaussian distribution with spread
below (\sANFDSl=5) and spread above \CF (\sANFDSl=2.5). This approach
assumed average octave separation between channels of 0.4 octaves,
approximating the calculated response area \citep{PaoliniClark:1999}.


The physiological effect of GABAergic inputs on onset choppers is
primarily on \CF, but the bandwidth is difficult to ascertain
\citep{CasparyHaveyEtAl:1979,PalombiCaspary:1992,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,CasparyPalombi:1993,CasparyPalombiEtAl:1993}.
The dendrites of \DS cells cover one third of the nucleus
(approximately 3 octaves of tonotopic frequencies) and occasionally
project into the \GCD \citep{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}.  Golgi cells'
axonal collaterals are confined to 200 \um in the \GCD.  
###and \ANF tonotopic organisation in the \GCD is less defined.  
The \GLG to \DS cell model connection within the \CNSM model was set to
a spread of 2 channels (i.e. SD= $\sqrt{2}$) with zero offset, which
corresponds to a \DS cell receiving synapses from \GLG cell models in a
narrow range of frequency channels.


The additional delay parameter for \ANF terminals on the \DS cell model,
\dANFDS, was shown in Section [[Synaptic Delays]].  The first spike latency
in high \CF \DS cells ($2.8 \pm 0.09$ ms) is precise and faster than other
stellate neurons in the \VCN \citep{RhodeSmith:1986}.  The additional
delay of 1.2 ms from \ANF to \DS input connections is a combination of
axonal conductance and dendritic delay.

In order to specify how \GLG cells regulate the click recovery response
in DS cells, a parameter optimisation routine was performed using data
from \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}.  Table
\ref{tab:DScellModelSummay}E describes the fitness function stimulus as
six pairs of masker-probe clicks separated by 50 ms.  Spike outputs of the \DS cell model were recorded
in 2 ms windows following the clicks accounting for the effective
minimum \FSL in \DS cells (consistent
with the experimental design of \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}).   
Figure \ref{fig:ClickExample} shows the
first two click pairs of the fitness function stimulus and recording method of the \DS cell model's output.

The six parameters to be fit by the routine were the weights of the \HSR \ANFs, \LSR \ANFs and \GLG
cell model synapses on \DS cells (\wHSRDS, \wLSRDS, \wGLGDS); the \GABAa
synapse fast and slow decay constants ($\tau_{\rm GABA-1}$, $\tau_{\rm GABA-2}$); and the \DS
cell maximum leak conductance (\gleak). 
Initial optimisation procedures
were not successful at constraining the short delay recovery responses
(2, 3, 4 ms), so the \DS cells' \Ileak conductance parameter
was included in the optimised parameters to allow the \DS cell model's
input resistance to fit fast-acting behaviour in the cell.


Figure \ref{fig:BackoffPalombi} shows the click recovery response of
unit G61.U6, an AVCN \OnC unit (CF 5.69, Th 30 dB SPL).  The \DS cell
model used in the optimisation had a CF of 5.8 kHz (channel no. 50).
Spontaneous activity in idle periods was used for additional weighted
penalty measures of spontaneous activity and to restrict over-excitation
by \ANFs.


# \PSTHs of the spiking output of \DS units
# were generated from 25 stimulus repetitions. Each response to a click
# was measured for a period of 2 ms.  The sample period was delayed by 4
# ms, an estimate of the auditory delay and minimum first spike latency
# for the DS unit.  The unit used in the optimisation had a CF = 5.8 kHz
# (channel no. 50).  Spontaneous activity in idle periods was used for
# additional weighted penalty measures of spontaneous activity and to
# restrict over-excitation by \ANFs.

# Parameters for \GLG cell inputs to \DS cells were
# optimised based on experimental click recovery data from
# \citet{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}, as shown in Figure
# \ref{fig:BackoffPalombi}.  The input stimulus presented a series of
# masker-probe clicks, with intervals of 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16 ms, separated
# by 50 ms.  Although the experimental stimuli was presented every 250 ms,
# the optimisation stimulus needed to be computationally efficient so the
# separation was shortened and the sequence reordered to obtain the best
# click recovery response in the \DS and Golgi cells.  The stimulus was
# repeated 25 times and a PSTH was produced from the DS cells' spikes.
# Spike counts for 2 ms after the probe and masker click were selected
# (accounting for the the minimum first spike latency for the unit) to
# calculate a recovery ratio.  The \DS cell optimisation function
# calculated the mean squared error between the test model and the
# experimental data recovery ratios to 5 click pairs.

Figure \ref{fig:DSClickRecoveryResult} shows the results of the optimised
parameters, shown in Table \ref{tab:DSClickRecoveryResults}, in the \DS cell model click recovery optimisation routine.  The
optimisation parameters show a clear favouritism toward the \LSR \ANF input
rather than the \HSR input to \DS units.  While this may not seem ideal
for fast coincidence detection, the large number of \HSR synapses
compensates for the small weight that was obtained in the optimisation.

Rate level curves to \CF tones and noise have been used as a
physiological measure of neurons in the auditory system since the
earliest experiments \citep{RoseGalambosEtAl:1959,SachsYoung:1978}.
Rate level curves are used to determine the threshold, dynamic range and
saturation rate in response to acoustic stimuli.  The dynamic range of
DS cells (\OnC and \OnL units) is much larger than their primary
afferent inputs (DS \gt 50 dB SPL, ANFs \lt 25 dB SPL)
\citep{Joris:1998,Rhode:1994,RhodeSmith:1986}.  The rate level responses
to \CF tones and broadband noise in an \OnC unit \citep[shown~in~Figure~12~from]{ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, were used as the
target data to fit the DS cell model.

\yellownote{TODO: More discussion about parameters. Ratelevel results reaffirm click recovery optimisation}
The \ANF weight parameters show a clear favouritism toward the \LSR input
over \HSR fibres, but the \HSR synapses outnumber the \LSR synapses by a ratio of 2:1.

The output of the DS cell model in the optimisation was strongly
determined by its input responses, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult} A and C.  \HSR fibres (all with \SR=50
sp/s) have low threshold to sounds and saturate at moderate sound
levels, as shown by the stable rate level responses to tones and noise
(orange circles in Figures \ref{fig:DSRateLevelResult}). These flat
responses at a high rate (approximately 250 sp/s) were not able to
manipulate the DS cell model in the optimisation other than to set a
threshold for tone and noise sounds.  \LSR fibres (SR=0.1 sp/s) and
Golgi units have much higher thresholds and wider dynamic ranges.

** Verification of the DS Cell Model



The optimised parameters for inputs to the \DS cell model were
applied to \DS cells across the whole network using tones, noise and
tones plus noise stimuli.  The behaviour of an individual \DS cell model output is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:DSverificationPSTH}, similar to the Golgi cell
model (Figure \ref{fig:GolgiVerification}).  Figure
\ref{fig:DSverificationPSTH}A and B shows the response of the central \DS
cell model (CF=5.8 kHz).
# The onset PSTH
# monotonic responses to tones and noise were similar to other Ghoshal and Kim
# units (Figure \ref{fig:GolgiKimFig2}).

** Background

# Alibardi:2003 In layer 3 of the DCN, glycinergic vertical neurons are present,
# and they have specific nuclear and synaptic characteristics that distinguish
# them from Golgi-stellate cells present in the same layer (Saint-Marie et
# al. 1991; Wickesber & Oertel, 1993; Alibardi, 1999b, 2000a). Vertical (or
# tuberculo-ventral) neurons form a local circuit that connects the dorsal to
# the ventral cochlear nuclei, and also contact the basal dendrites of pyramidal
# cells (Saint-Marie et al. 1991, 1993; Wickesberg & Oertel, 1993; Ferragamo et
# al. 1998).


# Tuberculoventral neurons in the deep layer of the \DCN provide a delayed,
# frequency-specific glycinergic inhibition to TS and DS cells in the \VCN
# \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1988}.  The dendrites of TV cells are
# aligned with \ANFs and indicating narrow frequency tuning. TV cells have low
# spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs; “pauser,” “chopper,” or
# “onset/sustained” have been recorded
# \citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}. They have little or no
# response to wide band noise and firing rates to \CF tones that are
# non-monotonic functions of intensity.

# Anterograde labelling in the \DCN suggests glycinergic Tuberculoventral cells
# project tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-\CF, but also to the adjacent
# low and high frequency side bands in the \AVCN
# \citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004}.  Ultra-structural
# labelling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggest \TV cells are inhibited by DS
# cells and from sources in the \DCN but excitatory inputs were not found from
# TS cells \citep{RubioJuiz:2004}.  Intracellular responses from labeled TV
# cells in the mouse show clear excitatory input from TS cells and diffuse
# inhibitory input from DS cells \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.

*** Morphology and Cellular Properties of Tuberculoventral Cells

\TV cells are glycinergic, inhibitory cells found in the deep layers of
the \DCN. They form local synaptic circuits with pyramidal cells and
also send axon collaterals to the \VCN. The dendrites of \TV cells are
aligned with \ANFs; consequently, they are also known as `vertical'
cells, and are tuned similarly to \ANFs \citep{Rhode:1999}.  \TV are
characterised as having unique cell bodies and synaptic characteristics
that distinguish them from other cells in the deep layer, namely Giant
cells and Golgi-stellate cells
\citep{SaintBensonEtAl:1991,WickesbergOertel:1993,Alibardi:2000b,Alibardi:1999}.

The intracellular response of \TV cells to injected currents are linear,
regularly-spaced \APs, indicating TV cells are simple
integrators \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.  The input resistance of TV cells
ranges from 80 to 125 M\Omega \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,Manis:1990}.

# the low spontaneous
# rates and high sound thresholds of Type II \DCN units might be caused by
# a high intrinsic electrical threshold \citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997};
# this is consistent with the responses of vertical cells to intracellular
# current injection \citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.

Anterograde labeling in the \DCN suggests \TV cells project
tonotopically to the \VCN not just on-CF, but also to the low and high
frequency side bands
\citep{MunirathinamOstapoffEtAl:2004,OstapoffMorestEtAl:1999}.  With
retrograde labelling in the \DCN, three types of ventro-tubercular units
in rats were identified \citep{FriedlandPongstapornEtAl:2003}, compared
with only two types in cats \citep{SmithRhode:1989,OertelWuEtAl:1990}.
These units are identified as \TS and \DS cells, with the third in rats
identified as small adendritic neurons.  \TV cells receive weak
mono-synaptic excitatory input, mainly on their dendrites, from \ANFs
\citep{OertelWu:1989,ZhangOertel:1993b}.

Ultra-structural labeling of synapses in the rat \DCN suggests that \TV
cells are inhibited by glycinergic \DS cells and from sources in the
\DCN \citep{Rubio:2005}.  Intracellular responses from labeled \TV cells
in the mouse show clear diffuse inhibitory input from \DS cells
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b,WickesbergOertel:1993}.  Evidence in the mouse
suggests \TV cells also receive excitation from \TS cells
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1993}, however \citet{Rubio:2005} found no \TS
terminals on rat \TV cells.
  
*** Acoustic Response of Tuberculoventral Cells

\TV cells have low spontaneous rates and variable \PSTHs (pauser,
chopper, wide-chopper or onset/sustained) have been recorded
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999}.  The complex
physiological characteristics of \DCN neurons are categorised into \EIRA
groups \citep{EvansNelson:1973,YoungBrownell:1976}.  Type I \EIRA units
reflect the responses of single \ANFs.  \TV cells have a non-monotonic
response to tones with increasing sound level and respond poorly to
broadband noise, and are categorised as Type II \EIRA units
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005}.  Units
with Type II \EIRA responses are sharply tuned; have thresholds 10 dB
higher than other units with which they are intermingled; and do not
respond to broad-band noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,YoungBrownell:1976,Young:1980,SachsYoung:1980,YoungVoigt:1982,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1990,YoungSpirouEtAl:1992,Rhode:1999}.
Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1} shows the recording of a single \TV cell,
with narrow tuning and weak response to noise
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.

#\TV cells are characterised as having a non-monotonic response to
#tones with increasing sound level and respond poorly to broadband
#noise \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NelkenYoung:1997,ReissYoung:2005},
#as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SpirouFig1}.
# Young and his colleagues have shown that most neurons in the deep DCN
# respond to sound with either of two major types of response maps, type
# II or Type IV
# \citep{EvansNelson:1973,ShofnerYoung:1985,VoigtYoung:1980,VoigtYoung:1990,Young:1980,YoungBrownell:1976}.

# Responses of tuberculoventral neurons to sound
Recorded \PSTHs of \TV cells /in vivo/ are variable (pause-build,
unusual chopper, or onset with sustained activity)
\citep{ShofnerYoung:1985,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  Recordings /in vitro/
show that \TV cells respond with regular chopper-like
behaviour to voltage-clamped current injection
\citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}.  The strong input from \DS cells across
frequencies contributes little or no response to wide band noise and
firing rates to \CF tones that are non-monotonic functions of intensity.
The low \SR and high sound thresholds of Type II \DCN
units might be caused by a high intrinsic electrical threshold
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}; this is consistent with the responses of
\TV cells to intracellular current injection
\citep{DingVoigt:1997,ZhangOertel:1993b}.


Pharmacological effects of neurotransmitter blockers have shown that \TV
cells (Type II \DCN units) are strongly regulated by glycinergic and
GABA-ergic inputs. \TV cells' zero spontaneous activity is still
maintained despite application of glycinergic or \GABAa blockers
\citep{DavisYoung:2000}. In response to sounds, strychnine and bicuculine
enable \TV cells to respond more vigorously to noise and lower the
threshold for tones \citep{DavisYoung:2000}.


Taken together with histological studies, the results suggest that \ANFs
(predominantly \LSR fibres) form the major excitatory input to Type II
\DCN units along with other excitation from TS cells.
# If true, this hypothesis could also explain the finding that
# Type II DCN units have consistently higher thresholds than \DCN
# principal cells \citep{YoungBrownell:1976} because \LSR fibres \citep{Liberman:1978}.  However, patterns
# of also have elevated thresholds relative to the lowest threshold
# auditory nerve innervation of the \DCN are most consistent with \HSR
# fibre innervation of \TV cell somata and \LSR fibre innervation of
# dendrites \citep{Liberman:1993}.  In that case, 
Type II units also supply an inhibitory input to the \VCN
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but the role of Type II terminals in the
\VCN is less clear.  Three different hypotheses have been raised.  
\citet{WickesbergOertel:1990} suggested that the role of Type II units
in spectral processing may be that of a delayed narrowband inhibitor in the \VCN, with important echo-suppression characteristics.
\citet{PaoliniClark:1998} suggest that this projection modulates the response thresholds of \VCN neurons.   
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} have suggested that the responses
of \DCN principal cells are strongly inhibited by this narrowband
source, especially at sharp spectral peaks close to their \BF.


*** Modelling of Tuberculoventral cells


\yellownote{ Expand previous studies of the DCN incl. TV cells}

\citet{ArleKim:1991a} were the first to show Type II \EIRA units with
  simple McCullock-Pitts point neuron models of the \DCN.
 - (From Hancock Davis Voigt 97) Blum et al. (1995) used a wideband
  inhibitory mechanism to create Type II unit responses in a model of
  the \DCN. In that model, each cell population was described by a
  mathematical formula for its steady-state rate-level function. This
  level of abstraction was used to focus specifically on the role of
  network connectivity in determining the steady-state behaviour of
  \DCN units. The level of abstraction employed in our model allows for
  examination of temporal response properties including PST histograms
  and cross-correlation analysis.
 - \citep{DunnVetterEtAl:1996} performed some modelling.
 - Most recent models from \citep{LomakinDavis:2008} and \citep{ReissYoung:2005}

Modelling of Type II units in the \DCN has been thoroughly investigated by
Davis and colleagues
\citep{YoungDavis:2002,HancockDavisEtAl:2001,DavisYoung:2000,SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,HancockDavisEtAl:1997,DavisVoigt:1996,DavisVoigt:1994,DavisVoigt:1991}.


To create a neural model with low spontaneous rate requires either
increasing the intrinsic spiking threshold or lowering the synaptic
strength of the inputs.  Intracellular observations in decerebrate
gerbils show higher thresholds in Type II units \citep{DingVoigt:1997}
and intracellularly recorded Type II units.  Another cause for Type II
behaviour of no spontaneous activity, is a preference of \LSR \ANFs over
\HSR fibres.  Whether \LSR fibres preference the deep layers of the \CN
is yet to be confirmed
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

# - \citep{Rhode:1999} Vertical cells in gerbils (mainly Type III)

The intrinsic mechanism is more favourable in Type II units, provided
there is sufficient inhibition and excitation
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}.  Consistent with previous \TV cell models
\citep{HancockDavisEtAl:1997}, the \CNSM model used the wide-band
inhibition of \DS cells onto \TV cells.  Studies of the circuitry of the
\DCN have shown that wide-band inhibition is necessary for accurate
modeling of the principal cells of the \DCN including Type II units
\citep{ReedBlum:1995,BlumReedEtAl:1995,ReedBlum:1997,BlumReed:1998}.

** Implementation

The implementation of the \TV cell model used in the \CNSM model and its
optimisation routines are described in Table \ref{tab:TVModelSummary}.
The \TV cell model was implemented with a single-compartment conductance
neural model of Type I-c, a classic regular firing unit
\citep{RothmanManis:2003b}.  The synaptic inputs to the \TV cell model
included excitation from \HSR and \LSR \ANFs, and inhibition from \DS
cells.  The weights (\wLSRTV, \wHSRTV) and number (\nLSRTV, \nHSRTV) of
\ANF synapses were used in the optimisation procedures to allow for
coarse and fine adjustments to the strength of excitation. The TV cell
model received \ANF inputs from only one frequency channel at the same
CF (\sANFTV=0).  The strength of inhibition in the \TV cell model was
controlled by the weight and number of \DS cell inputs (\wDSTV,
\nDSTV). These parameters were included in the rate level
optimisation. The parameters controlling the distribution of \DS cell
inputs to \TV cells were fixed (\sDSTV=3, \oDSTV=0) in the rate level
optimisation and are the focus of the next section of this chapter,
Section [[Results%20of%20Tone%20and%20Noise%20Rate%20Level%20Optimisation%20][Results of Tone and Noise Rate Level Optimisation ]].  The
reversal potential of TV cells (\Erev) was also optimised to allow
modulation of the level of the resting membrane potential from the
default Type I \RM neural model.

** Results of Tone and Noise Rate Level Optimisation

Figure \ref{fig:TVRateLevelResult} shows the best fitted output
behaviour of the optimised TV cell model (Table
\ref{tab:TVRateLevelFig8B}) and its inputs to target data from the unit
in Figure 8A in \citet{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} (see Figure
\ref{fig:SpirouFig8}). The target unit had an elevated threshold to
noise relative to \BF tones and no change in threshold when strychnine
was applied.  The optimised TV cell model was able emulate this response
in tones but not in noise (Figure \ref{fig:TVRateLevelResult}D).

\yellownote{Fix verification plots and text for TV RL}

The optimised parameters for inputs to the \TV cell model were applied
to all \TV units across the whole network using tones, noise and tones
plus noise stimuli.  Unlike the Golgi cell model, the rate-level
response of TV cells is non-linear and the noise rate-level is strongly
inhibited (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A).  This is typical of the
Type II \EIRA units in the deep layer of the \DCN
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,Rhode:1999}.  The PSTH response of the
central \TV unit (CF=5.8 kHz) at 90 dB \SPL is a simple chopping
response, characteristic of the Type I-c \RM neural model (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}A) \citep{RothmanManis:2003b}. The minimum first
spikes occur at 4.3 ms after the stimulus onset (similar to the
un-optimised \TV model's mean \FSL in Section [[Synaptic Delays]]). 

Due to the strong \DS inhibition, the peak \FSL of the optimised \TV cell model
was delayed to 6.5 ms for a 50 dB SPL tone (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}A). In response to loud noise, the onset spike
and the chopping behaviour is suppressed (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}B).
# The \TV model outputs' behaviour
# is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}, similar to the Golgi cell
# model Figure \ref{fig:Golgiverification}.  
Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}A and B show the response of the central
\TV model (CF=5.8 kHz). The PSTH in Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}B is
a wide chopper, generated from regular firing Type I-c \RM neural model
and the strong onset inhibition from DS cells.  Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}C 
shows the wide response of all \TV units in
the network to a 5.8 kHz tone with increasing sound level.  The masked
response curves (Figure \ref{fig:TVverification}D) show the wide-band
inhibition particularly for tones above \CF. The responses of all \TV
units to pure tones replicate the single channel excitatory inputs from
\ANFs and wide-band inhibition from \DS units (Figure
\ref{fig:TVverification}C and D).

# of Wide-band Inhibition onto TV Cells Using Notch Noise Responses


Table \ref{tab:TVNotchModelSummary} shows the implementation methods
used in the \TV cell model notch noise optimisation.  The main purpose
of this optimisation was to test whether \DS cell connection distribution
variables (i.e. spread and offset) play a role in modifying the output
of \TV cells (as suggested by \citet{ReissYoung:2005}).
# The experimental data used in the fitness function, from
# \citet{ReissYoung:2005} recorded from individual \TV neurons, is
# adapted for a range of \TV cell models using a single notch stimulus.
The experimental data in Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9} shows the average
responses of Type II \DCN units to notch sweeps \citep{ReissYoung:2005}.
The optimisation routine would be prohibitive if it used multiple notch
sweeps simulated using a single neuron.  To avoid this outcome, the
optimisation used a single notch presented across the whole network of
\TV cells.  Accordingly, the fitness function took the relative position
of cells in the network into account when comparing the experimental
data.  For example, when presented with a notch noise filtered between
5 kHz and 10 kHz, a unit with \CF of 5 kHz will see a falling edge of a
1 octave notch, whereas a unit with \CF of 10 kHz will see a rising
edge of a half octave notch.  Figure \ref{fig:TVNotchDiagram} shows the
combination of the Type II \DCN unit notch data for 1 octave.

The notch sweep sets used by \citeauthor{ReissYoung:2005} were generated
with logarithmically constant notch widths and notch centre frequencies
ranging from 1 octave below to 1 octave above \CF in $1/50$ octave
steps.  The single notch noise stimulus presented in this optimisation
routine was generated in [[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using frozen Gaussian noise
(100 kHz sampling rate) and a Chebyshev Type II band reject filter.[fn::
The \textsf{[[latex:progname][cheby2}]] function is in the octave-forge signal package and
MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox.]  The sound level in the
\citet{ReissYoung:2005} data added further complexity.  The power
spectrum was maintained at a constant level per frequency band (dB per
Hz$^{1/2}$) and this was scaled at each point in the notch sweep.  For the
single presentation used in this experiment the sound level plays an
important part in stimulating the \ANFs and contributing
interneurons. From the previous optimisation 
(Section [[Tuberculoventral%20Cell%20Model][Tuberculoventral Cell Model]]), the preliminary response to noise in \TV cell models was linear between 40 to 80 dB SPL.


Higher thresholds in Type II \DCN units \citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999} and
the presence of multiple inhibitory synapses \citep{Alibardi:2006}
suggest \TV cells either receive a strong inhibitory influence or they
have a lower \RMP due to a lower leak current reversal potential. A
reduced resting membrane potential may increase the threshold for
excitatory inputs to generate action potentials. To allow for this, the
reversal potential of the TV cell model (\Erev) was used as a parameter
in the optimisation routine with a range from -80 to -50 mV.

Table \ref{tab:TVNotchresult}

The eventual result of the \DS to \TV connection optimisation,
highlighted in Table \ref{tab:TVNotchresult}, was derived from Run 1A and
Run 1B in the set using 70 dB \SPL stimulus.  The optimisation produced
a better result for the offset parameter and the overall error value of
the fitness function.  The offset of \DS onto \TV cells at 2.1 channels,
equivalent to a mean of 0.14 octaves (0.34 octaves at the lowest channel
and 0.13 at the highest channel), was closer to the offset predicted by
\citet{ReissYoung:2005}.

The results in the \TV cell model not optimisation  show the dominance of \LSR
over \HSR fibres in the number of synapses (29 to 1) and the increased
need for \DS cell inhibition with a high number of synapses, \nDSTV.  \LSR fibres have not
been proven to preference the deep layers of the \DCN
\citep{Ryugo:2008,MeltzerRyugo:2006,RyugoParks:2003,BabalianJacommeEtAl:2002}.

** Verification of Notch Sweep Response in the TV Cell Model 

The response of individual Type II \DCN units to notch and band-pass sweeps
in Figure \ref{fig:TVReissFig9} 
\citep[from Figure 9 in][]{ReissYoung:2005} was the target data used for the
optimisation of \DS cell connections to \TV cells.  To replicate the
response of a single unit to notch sweeps, notches were generated in
[[latex:progname][MATLAB/GNU Octave]] using Chebychev II filters with a sampling rate of 100
kHz and an optimal filter number.  The half octave sweep was calculated
from -2 to 2 octaves away from 12.7 kHz at 1/32$^{nd}$ increments with
logarithmically constant notch widths. A 50 ms stimulus at 50 dB SPL was
established in the \AN model for use by the \CNSM model.[fn::
Logarithmically constant means the notch width is calculated at the
centre frequency of the notch and not the \CF of the unit of interest.]
Figure \ref{fig:TVSweepUnit70} shows the response of a unit with similar
\CF (\TV unit 70, \CF = 12.76 kHz) to notch and band-pass noise.

* T Stellate Cell Model: Three Chopper Subtypes

This section reports on the major output neurons in the \CNSM model, T
stellate cells, which are classified into three sub-types based on their
regular firing or chopper characteristics.

** Background


A considerable literature exists on the \TS
cells of the \VCN \citep[see~review~][]{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  The first extracellular
physiology studies classified supposed \TS cells into regular-firing
choppers \citep{Bourk:1976,Pfeiffer:1966}.  With further developments in
analysis and classification techniques, \TS cells were segregated into
slowly or transiently adapting and sustained chopper sub-types
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.  In cats,
\citet{SmithRhode:1989} were the first to perform simultaneous labelling of
\TS cells, and they confirmed the physiological response of Type I multipolar
neurons as units classified as choppers.  This simultaneous classification and labelling
was followed by others in gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}, guinea pigs
\citep{PalmerWallaceEtAl:2003,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004}, and rats
\citep{PaoliniClarkEtAl:1997,PaoliniClark:1999,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004}. In
each of these studies, there were no morphological properties that
segregated transient and sustained choppers, which indicates that synaptic
inputs play a strong role in determining the output of \TS cells.

The technique of averaging intracellular membrane responses to acoustic input to determine
stochastic excitatory\slash inhibitory inputs was first used in the
chopper units of gerbils
\citep{OstapoffFengEtAl:1994,FengKuwadaEtAl:1994}.
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005} used similar averaging of \TS and DS cell
intracellular responses in rats as the basis for a thorough statistical
analysis to separate chopper units into three distinct subtypes.  Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} shows the intracellular acoustic classification of
chopper units in the rat into three types
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}: ChS chopper sustained, and two transient
choppers, ChT1 and ChT2.  The intracellular traces in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniAIV} along with the \CV statistics in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata} formed the basis for the optimisation routine
of the \TS cell model of each chopper type in the \CNSM model.

The categorisation via \CV is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PaoliniCVdata}.  Sustained choppers maintain a stable CV below
0.2 throughout the entire stimulus. The transient chopper optimisation
had two types defined by \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The first CT
type is categorised with \CV starting below 0.2 then rising, hence the
name transient, but stays below 0.3.  The second CT type is regular in
the first 10 ms period, but rises to 0.3 or above throughout the
stimulus.

*** Synaptic connections

\yellownote{TODO: complete synaptic connections to TS cell section}

The \CNSM model shown in Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}

Recurrent synaptic connection between TS cells have been the focus of
recent neural models
\citep{BahmerLangner:2006,BahmerLangner:2006a,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}.
They were not included in the \CNSM model because  of the rarity of small round vesicles on \ChS units
\citep{SmithRhode:1989}. Additionally, \citet{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} reported that \EPSPs in one \TS cell were likely to come from only one input. Consequently, because of the weak influence of \TS cell recurrent connections they were not included in the \CNSM model.

\yellownote{Improve this paragraph to describe influence of \Ih and \IKA in the \TS cell model}
Figure \ref{fig:TSinputs} omits the non-linear dynamics
of the action potential in the neural model. The hyperpolarisation
activation of \Ih and \IKA currents due to inhibitory input are not
evident.  The second factor is important in enhancing the first spike
response across the T stellate cells \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2004} to
an oncoming stimulus, since the \OnC units will respond earlier and
provide fast inhibition.




*** Fitness Function

The optimisation fitness function, $F$, of the \TS cell model
calculated the relative error between a combination of the intracellular
and spike statistics against the experimental data by
\citet{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  Spike trains were collected for 25
repetitions of a 50 ms \CF tone and analysed for \PSTH characteristics
\citep{Pfeiffer:1966a,BlackburnSachs:1989,YoungRobertEtAl:1988}.
Chopper \PSTHs without the first three regular spikes were disregarded.
CV for the inter-spike intervals were calculated
over 10 ms windows \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The intracellular
voltage statistics included the onset ratio (Equation
\ref{eq:IVstats-Onset}), adaptation shift (Equation
\ref{eq:IVstats-Adap}) and offset shift (Equation
\ref{eq:IVstats-Offset}).  
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:IVstats-Onset} \textrm{Onset Ratio} &= \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=0}^{t=5}\quad/\quad \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=20}^{t=25} \\
  \label{eq:IVstats-Adap} \textrm{Adaptation} &= \bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=20}^{t=21}\quad - \quad\bar{\mathbf{v}}|_{t=50}^{t=51} \\

  \end{eqnarray}
#+END_LaTeX

The fitness value was a square root of the
mean squared errors between the computed \AIV and \CV statistics of the
target units and the simulated \TS model.  The final fitness value had
additional penalties for \SR above 10 spikes per second and for \CV
values above 0.3 in the first 10 ms and above 0.4 for the remaining
stimulus.

*** Sustained Chopper

\glsreset{ChS} 
Figure \ref{fig:CSresults} shows the optimisation
results for the \ChS unit 01-864-004 from
\citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}, with \CF 3.9 kHz.  This unit had a
depolarisation threshold at 10 dB and a firing rate saturation at 75
dB \SPL.  The stimulus for the optimisation routine was a pure tone 30
dB above depolarisation threshold at \CF (3.9 kHz 40 dB \SPL), 5 ms
on\slash off cosine squared ramp.  A 20 ms delay was included to allow
the model to reach a sustained \RMP. The ChS model unit had CF of
3.872 kHz due to the separation of frequency channels in the model.


The best parameters found by the optimisation and shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CSresults}, were very high excitatory input (\wLSRTS =
2.86796 nS, \wHSRTS = 2.01089 nS) and moderate to high inhibition
(\wDSTS 0.291181 nS, \wTVTS 0.884174 nS, \wGLGTS 0.749812 nS).  The low
input stimulus level meant that the majority of synaptic input came
from \HSR fibres.  There was a slight increase in the leak conductance
($\gleak=6.57345e-4 \textrm{S/cm}^2$ ) from the initial value
(4.907e-4), causing a decrease in the input resistance to 120
M$\Omega$ from 163 M$\Omega$.  The final error, calculated with more
weight on the CV variables, was 0.839952.  Post-tone hyperpolarisation
(reference 1.30035, best \ChS model -0.029843) and the first \CV value
(ref 0.1543, best \ChS model 0.49706) had the greatest difference.
The poor initial \CV response was due to the irregular first spike.
The large excitatory \HSR input causes spikes to occur after tone
onset, just before the stimulus invoked spike arrival at the \TS cell
3 ms later, but still included in the \CV calculation.

\yellownote{TODO: Note the ChS optimisation had added weight to the CV values
in the error calculation.  The PSTH and IV trace do not even show a
decent chopping behaviour.}  

\yellownote{TODO: The peaks for the IV are 3.66,
6.77, and 10.99 ms. The AN model input is affected by the rat audiogram,
the low CF and low level.  This shifts the arrival time of spikes to the
TS model, and a raw IV comparison would need to be shifted by approx 2
ms. The onset ratio and the first CV value are effected by this.}

\yellownote{TODO: Synaptic weight in the model above 0.002 will initiate a
spike at each input spike, similar to the calyx synapse on bushy
cells. This means that the TS cell will respond with a primary-like or
primary with notch PSTH. Dendritic filtering could improve this but the
high synaptic weights do not seem like a realistic physiological option
for small bouton endings in the CN.}

\yellownote{TODO: The RMP of the experimental data was relatively high, and if
this was produced in a model the spontaneous rate would be close to 100
spikes per seconds.  The IV measures allow for comparison of the
experimental and model data that is independent of the RMP.}

\yellownote{TODO: Hand tuning creates many types of ChS models, but the best
effects are when you smooth out the input with dendritic filtering.
This can be used in a single compartment using a higher time constant on
the synapse or better, using a double-exponential synapse with longer
onset and decay time constants. Very high excitatory inputs saturates
the cell and it will spike repeatedly in a regular fashion but the onset
is too precise. See ChT2 IV trace for an example of precise onset. I was
able to generated a good IV trace when the full trace was the error
function at higher SPL and higher CF, but this was unable to generate
the same trace for 3.9 KHz at 40 dB or a sustained CV. }

*** Transient Chopper 1

The \ChT1 unit chosen for the optimisation was unit 01-857-007, CF=8.2
kHz \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.  The depolarisation threshold for
this unit was 55 dB \SPL, close to the average 47.2 dB \SPL for all
\ChT1 units.  The stimulus for the optimisation routine was an 85 dB 8.2
kHz pure tone and the exemplar \TS cell model had CF 8.27 kHz.

The optimisation results of \ChT1 are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CT1results} with a final error of 0.839141 without weighting.
Moderate excitatory synaptic weights (\wLSRTS 8.22E-4, \wHSRTS
0.000620294) were balanced with moderate to low glycinergic synaptic input
(\wDSTS 0.000148518, \wTVTS 0.000195416).  The GABAergic input weight
was very low (\wGLGTS 1.70742e-05), but the loud input stimulus (85 dB)
would cause reasonable inhibition to the \TS cell throughout the
stimulus.  The leak conductance had a slight decrease (\gleak
0.000409819).

*** Transient Chopper 2

The \ChT2 unit (01-305-014, CF 12.4 kHz \citep*{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005})
was used for the \ChT2 TS cell model (CF 12.2 kHz) optimisation. This
unit had a low depolarising threshold (5 dB \SPL) so the stimulus level
was set to 35 dB \SPL; a significant difference from the \ChT1
optimisation unit that was optimised using an 85 dB \SPL tone.  The main difference between the transient chopper types
is reflected in their \CV values after 10 ms, with the \ChT2 type
becoming irregular (i.e. having a CV value over 0.3) and maintaining
that regularity for the remainder of the stimulus.  \ChT2 has a higher
reduction in onset depolarisation (90.2\%) compared to ChT1, and
post-tone inhibition is greater (8.82 mV) \citep*{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}.

The microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus is one of the

high fidelity sensory input to be passed to higher order centres, by
reproducing the spectrum in a robust fashion
\citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,May:2003} and synchronisation to significant

replicating wide-band inhibition offset necessary, or is rate ratio
between TS/DS/TV the most important?  Mammalian studies show that the
TV cells receive input from TS cells, but not in rats}

*** Chopper Subtypes: T Stellate Cell Models

The primary purpose of this optimisation study was to pinpoint the network parameters that regulate the major output of
the \CN stellate microcircuit.




** Limitations of the CN stellate microcircuit model

All \BNN models are limited by a number of factors.  Firstly, the level
of detail in the neural models set the underlying complexity and
dynamics that are possible within the \BNN.  Secondly, the connectivity
and synaptic parameters, which set the network dynamics, are often
hand-tuned or guessed. Finally, the background and driving inputs to
the network set the environmental conditions for genuine realistic
models to be compared with experimental animal network under the same
conditions and inputs.

The level of detail in the neural models of the \CNSM model includes the
complex channel dynamics of a \HH conductance model.  Three potassium
current channels (\IKHT, \IKLT, and \IKA) and the mixed cation
hyperpolarisation current (\Ih) were fit precisely from \VCN neurons in
mice \citep{RothmanManis:2003,RothmanManis:2003a,RothmanManis:2003b}.
More complex multi-compartment conductance model could have been chosen
to include dendritic filtering, especially in \DS and \TS cells, and
already present in existing stellate models
\citep{WangSachs:1995,WiegrebeMeddis:2004}.
Dendritic filtering in each of the cells was not included. 


\yellownote{TODO: AM coding in model is not verified by
\citet{ZilanyBruce:2006} model, and it was superseded by the addition
of a power-law functions in the synapse \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}}



** Implications of sequential microcircuit optimisation



\yellownote{TODO: Probability distribution of delay (within cell-to-cell
connection) not included.}

\yellownote{TODO: Probability of AP-to-synaptic release ratio not included
(Liley assumption of 1\% vesicle release in cortical buttons.) }


* Conclusion 

Figure [[*Optimisation%20Results][Optimisation Results]]

# Example conclusion The purpose for performing the experiments herein
# was to gain insights into the functional relevance of the Type II
# neurons by analysing their endogenous firing features. The observed
# electrophysiological diversity between the two classes of primary
# auditory neurons argues for different roles for the Type I and II
# neurons. In contrast to the Type I spiral ganglion neurons, the type
# II neurons show markedly distinct kinetics and receive a classically
# convergent innervation pattern that is also present in other sensory
# systems. Like the rod neural circuitry in the retina, the Type II
# spiral ganglion neurons appear to be designed to integrate input
# from the many receptors that they innervate. This would have very
# little impact, however, on signal detection without the process of
# temporal summation. The slow kinetics of the Type II spiral ganglion
# neurons, along with their ability to respond at relatively
# Hyperpolarising voltage levels, are features consistent with mechanisms
# designed to detect low-intensity stimuli.

The purpose of the optimisation experiments was to
develop a biophysically-realistic neural network model of the stellate
microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus.  The methods used in this section
are a practical and realistic means for constructing microcircuits with
sensory or feature-based topography. They exploit extensive experimental
evidence that describes the behaviour of each interneuron in the
network.  The tabular reporting format for neural network modelling, as
suggested by \citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009}, was followed so that
other researchers can easily reproduce this work.
