% \begin{synopsis}
%   Modelling large biophysically-based neural network models is
% 	 comlicated by the large parameter space, various sources of
% 	 experimental data and the existence of stochasticity in

\section{Conclusion}


In this section I developed a biophysically-realistic model of the
T-stellate microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus.

\medskip{}

The methods used in this section are a practical and realistic means
for constructing microcircuits with sensory or feature-based
topography.  I followed the neural network modeling format as
suggested by \citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} so that other
researchers may easily reproduce this work.
