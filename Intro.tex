\section{Introduction    \label{sec:CN:introduction}}

Shihab Shamma calls upon the science community, particularly members of its
physiology and neuroscience subgroups, to investigate the role of populations of
neurons in to pay attention to the role of populations of neurons in
neurophysiology. This chapter draws on the wealth of experimental data
accumulated in auditory neuroscience to create a detailed, \BNN~model of the
cochlear nucleus stellate cell network. The design and methods for the
construction of the model shall provide insights relevant to other neural
network models of the brain, especially those that use highly-specific sensory
pathways.  \yellownote{One more sentence here - expand on idea at the start and
  link to next para.}

Although it remains the case that ``choices, assumptions, and guesses [are] an
integral part of neuronal modeling'' \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}
\yellownote{page no.}, there is much to be gained from biophysically-realistic
modelling approaches, especially in the heavily investigated cochlear nucleus in
birds and mammals. Developments in computational power and enhanced experimental
techniques in multi-unit recordings are enabling more detailed neural models to
be developed. Examples of parameter estimation and fitting in neural models are
also becoming more advanced, for example SSNNS,
\citep{SichtigSchafferEtAl:2008}, NeuroFitter \citep{VanAchardEtAl:2007} and
MultiRunFitter (a feature in NEURON).\yellownote{need to explain my intentions}

\yellownote{See  neural detail in auditory system\citep{LuRubioEtAl:2008}}

% {Discuss use of Poisson models vs HH-like models.  Discuss single cell
% simulation vs whole network simulation during optimisation.}
To develop and optimise detailed neural models and neural network models,
reproducible research methods are required. In this chapter, a tabular method
introduced by \citet{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is used to summarise the neural
models used in each optimisation step. The tables consist of A) the model
summary, B) cell type populations, C) connectivity between two cell types, D)
neuron and synapse models, and E) optimisation parameters.  This method aims to
show a consistent and recognisable format for presenting various neural network
models and their constituents. \yellownote{this needs more explanation in the
  methods sections}

% \smallskip{}

The standard methods for optimisation can be simply described with the following
steps:\begin{itemize}
\item specify function or model we want to optimise
\item specify criterion we want to satisfy
\item specify the parameters that will be adjusted, 
  and any constraints on those parameters and finally
\item perform the optimization.
\end{itemize}
In attempting to create a realistic microcircuit the parameter optimisation
routine, these steps need to be reiterated in sequential stages. The parameters
chosen in the sequential optimisation stages should be chosen so that they do
not influence the properties of previously fitted parameters.

% \smallskip{}

In this chapter, the connections within the stellate network
(Fig.~\ref{fig:microcircuit}) are developed using a sequential method of
optimisation steps.  The parameters of each cell type are determined based on
experimental data or are optimised based solely on responses to simple stimuli.
Each cell type is shown with its \gls{EIRA} and \gls{PSTH}, although this may
vary within cell types.


\yellownote{what is this sentence doing? explain the figure!}  The stellate
network model drawn in Fig.~\ref{fig:microcircuit} describes the following cells
and models:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Carney phenomenological auditory model \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}:
  This model provides spiking input to cochlear nucleus neurons across
  frequencies and spontaneous rate types of the auditory nerve from an arbitrary
  input stimulus. The base line in Fig.~\ref{fig:microcircuit} is a
  simplification of auditory nerve fibres (ANF) from low best frequency (BF) to
  high BF (left to right). The model reproduces responses for high and low SR
  ANFs at 100 channels across the frequency range 200 Hz to 48 kHz.
\item The Golgi cell: a {GABA}ergic \VCN~marginal shell unit that is presumed to
  regulate excitability in the \GCD and core \VCN~units
  \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}. Only one \textit{in vivo} study has
  recorded extracellular data in the marginal shell area of the
  \CN~\citep{GhoshalKim:1997}. The presumed characteristics of Golgi cells are
  taken from that study and are defined by a monotonic response to tones and
  noise, a type I/III \EIRA, and an unusual or chopper {\PSTH}.
\item The D~stellate cell: a glycinergic, large multipolar cell with
  \OnC~\PSTH~response that acts as a coincidence detector. Its large
  dendritic area increases its response to noise allowing it to behave as a
  wide-band inhibitor in the \VCN, \DCN, and contralateral \CN
  \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004,NeedhamPaolini:2007}.
\item The Tuberculoventral cell: a glycinergic, type II {\EIRA} unit in the deep
  layer of the \DCN~\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999}.  This cell acts as a delayed
  echo-suppressor and narrow-band inhibitor, with recurrent connections between
  D~and T~stellate cells in the \VCN~\citep{Alibardi:2006,OertelWickesberg:1993,WickesbergWhitlonEtAl:1991}.
\item the T~stellate cell: one of the major output projection cells of the
  cochlear nucleus to the inferior colliculus. This multipolar neuron has been
  shown to have robust spectral representation and enhanced synchronisation to
  modulation in speech sounds
  \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.

A detailed \BNN model requires a good input model, a good neural model and
experimental data with which to fit the parameters.  \yellownote{In this para:

  of the Carney model in the CN stellate model.}

\section{Auditory Model    \label{sec:CN:auditory-model}}

Advanced auditory fidelity and localisation is an exceptional feature of hearing
perception in animals.  This speciality works to a high degree despite the input
at the round window of the cochlea being one dimensional and very noisy.
Modelling in the auditory periphery has benefited extensively from the work of
Liberman, Greenwood, Patterson, Young, Sachs and others, in acoustic \texttt{in
  vivo} experiments. Models of the auditory system over the last 30 years have
expanded our understanding of the mechanical processes in the middle ear and
cochlea, and the specialised synapse between the inner hair cell and the
auditory nerve \citep{DavisVoigt:1991,Carney:1993,MeddisHewittEtAl:1990}.

% \smallskip{}

The auditory system is topographically ordered from the basilar membrane to the
cortex in terms of frequency selectivity, also called tonotopicity
\citep{YoungOertel:2004}.  The population of auditory nerve fibres (ANFs,
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNdiagram}), bifurcate after entering the cochlear nucleus to
innervate the \VCN~and \DCN\@, retaining their tonotopic order
\citep{Lorente:1981, Liberman:1982, Liberman:1993}. Type 1 ANFs are categorised
into {\HSR} and {\LSR} fibres \citep{Liberman:1978}, where LSR fibres have a
higher threshold and wider dynamic range than HSR fibres. They also project to
the \GCD~\citep{RyugoParks:2003, RyugoHaenggeliEtAl:2003} along with the
smaller, unmyelinated type 2 \ANFs, which suggests they play a different role in
sound processing to \HSR fibres.

In examining the properties of a detailed neural model of the cochlear nucleus,
a realistic and phenomenologically sound auditory model is needed to represent
sounds and transformations that occur in the central auditory system.

\subsection{Auditory model    \label{sec:CN:resp-audit-models}}

The auditory nerve inputs to the cochlear nucleus model neurons are provided by
phenomenological auditory periphery models originating from
\citet{Carney:1993}. The ARLO model \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001}; the Bruce model
\citep{BruceSachsEtAl:2003, ZilanyBruce:2006, ZilanyBruce:2007}; and the Zilany
model \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}. The AN model consists of an outer/middle ear
pre-processing filter, a cochlea filterbank, IHC-to-AN synapse model and
dead-time modified Poisson spike generator, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ZilanyBruceFig}. \citep{HeinzZhangEtAl:2001} incorporated cochlea
filters based on the critical bandwidths obtained from psychophysical
experiments in humans. The ARLO model of the cat auditory periphery, with
non-linear compression and two-tone suppression, is used in this study except in
the vowel simulation where the human auditory periphery model is used.
\yellownote{TODO: AN model paragraph has been changed - fix any comment related
  to new Zilany}

% \smallskip{}

% The \citet{ZilanyBruce:2007} model improves the previous AN model by an
% additional signal path and its predictions have matched a wide range of
% physiological data in normal and impaired cat data. The most recent AN model
% comprises an power-law synapse model, with internal $1/f$ noise, that enhances
% the behaviour of long-term dependence in ANFs \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.

% \smallskip{}

% \yellownote{Why is it the cat model? updating Carney model?} Updating of the
% Carney auditory model has led to the change in the model's configuration from an
% original implementation of the rat model.  The default species is the cat and
% will be used in the data presented in this chapter.

\subsection{Spiking in Poisson neural models    \label{sec:CN:spiking-poiss-neur}}

The neural models used in the auditory nerve fibres and Golgi cell model are
inhomogeneous Poisson processes. The instantaneous rate is passed through the
Jackson model, which includes refractory effects typical of the auditory nerve
fibres \citep{Jackson:2003,JacksonCarney:2005}.  Spike trains for each neuron in
the model are created at the start of each repetition of the stimulus, but can
be saved and loaded from file.




% \yellownote{TODO: serious reworking to be done here} 

% Analysis of the frequency
% response area of ANF generates known parameters for each fibre, these are:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the spontaneous rate (SR), generated in silence and is
%   categoried into two groups High SR ($>$18 sp/s) and Low SR ($<$ 18
%   sp/s);
% \item threshold, the sound pressure level(SPL) at which the cell
%   responds above the spontaneous rate
% \item characteristic frequency (CF)
% \end{itemize}
