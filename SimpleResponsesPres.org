* The Problem of Parameters 

** Optimisation of Neural Networks

*** Realistic neural networks
    - Large parameter space 
      - Cell-based: size, morphology
      - Current channels: density, location, conductance 
      - Network based: 
	- Synapses: number, weight 
        - Distribution: place-based, location on cell

    - Neural Model: Poisson, I&F, Simplified HH, Hodgkin-Huxley models

    - Stochastisity
      - Input noise
      - Synaptic noise 
      - Indeterminate connectivity


** Fitting Cell Types
   
 Intracellular behaviour unique to every cell\\
 Fit to \citet{RothmanManis:2003a}

** Basics of Optimisation
   
   1) Define model
   2) Vector of Parameters
   3) Error function that takes in parameter vector outputs fitness value
    - Stimulus -> AN model -> Golgi -> Spike Generation
    - Run N times (saving data i.e spikes, voltages)
    - Process output, Calculate error relative to reference
   4) Run Principle-Axis method
   5) Set attributes of optimisation


# ** Genetic Algorithms
#    - Avoid local minima
#    - Solution is evolved from simple building blocks
#    - Genome \rightarrow Network Params \rightarrow Evaluation using NEURON \rightarrow Fitness

** Golgi Cell Model :  Experimental evidence
   Anatomical 
   - LSR fibers project to GCD \citep{BensonBerglundEtAl:1996}
   Morphological \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a}
   - small cell (12-15 micron soma), uniform dendrites and axonal collaterals 100 micron 
   Intracellular \cite{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a} (mice, GCD /in vitro/)

# \small{Rate level response of unit S03-07 (CF 21~kHz) \citep[Fig.2]{GhoshalKim:1997}}
   
** Golgi Cell Model :  Key design factors
 - Choosing neural model: HH-type or Poisson
 - Problem of monotonic excitation at low level
  - added HSR to model to avoid added computation of MSR
 - Spread of ANF to GCD ARE broader than core VCN
#  - are we spoiling the broth too early? 

** Golgi Cell Model :  Implementation
   - Generate  auditory filterbank vectors (*L* and *H*)
   - Golgi Cell Dendritic filter: alpha function
#    - Create Golgi vectors from AN vectors
#     1. For each channel, create 2 Golgi weighted vector across filterbank:\mu = channel position, \sigma = spatial spread of LSR  connections to Golgi
#     2. Create Golgi vectors by summating ANF inputs weighted by *w*   
#     3. Convolve the golgi vector with the alpha synaptic function

      w(i,j) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left\{-\frac{(i-j)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}, i,j \in [0,nchannels-1] \\
      \mathbf{g}_i = \sum^{i} w_L(i)\mathbf{L}_i + w_H(i)\mathbf{H}_i \\

** Golgi Cell Model :  Optimisation Procedure

*Fitting Data*: 
   - monotonic rate-level curve, unit S03-07 (CF 21 kHz) Ghoshal and Kim (1997) 
*Optimisation*: 
   - Measure spike rate of golgi model at several sound levels, calc mean squared error between experimental data and golgi
   model data

** Golgi Cell Model :  Results

| Parameter                | Range | Best Value |
|--------------------------+-------+------------|
| \sANFGLG   (chan.)       |  0-10 | 2.48       |
| \tau_{\ANFGLG} (ms)      |  0-20 | 5.01       |
| \wLSRGLG      (unitless) |   0-5 | 0.515      |
| \wHSRGLG      (unitless) |   0-5 | 0.0487     |
| Spon. rate    (spikes/s) |  0-50 | 3.37       |

** Golgi Cell Model :  Outcomes
 
  - Good fit of golgi model to Ghoshal and Kim data, using just the tone  rate-level.
  - Dominance of LSR weight parameter over HSR weight 
   - no evidence for HSR axons in GCD, here it adds background activity similar to the granule cells or type-II ANFs 

  - Fast processing of golgi output using Poisson rate model

* D-stellate (DS) Cell Model: GABAergic effects on click recovery

*Morphological* 
   - large Multipolar cell
   - electrotonic dendrites stretching 200 microns (one third of VCN), one half DCN, cCN 
   - receive large number of ANF syn to dend and soma
   - receive large number of Gly and GABA syn to soma dend
*Intracellular*
   - type I-II current clamp response
   - presence of Ih and small amounts of KLT currents
   - delay from shock to ANFs less than 1 ms 

** D Stellate Cell Model:  Experimental evidence

*Physiological* 
   - Onset chopper PSTH, fast narrow FSL 
   - Wide response area (+1 oct and -2 oct)
   - high sync index, Low-pass MTF
   - monotonic response to tones and noise 

** D Stellate Cell Model:  Key design factors
Neural Model \rightarrow Type I-II RM model
     
GABA synapse: counter intuitive -> slow synapse controlling click recovery less than
     the delay and time constant of the synapse => add KLT and leak
     conductance to change Rothman and Manis CN model

DS-DS possible \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}, TV-DS possible \citep{ZhangOertel:1993b}

Simulation time reduced due to golgi and Poisson models
     providing input to single DS cell model

** D Stellate Cell Model:  Implementation

   - Generate AN vectors in auditory filterbank
   - Create Golgi filterbank
   - Pass AN and Golgi spikes onto single DS cell model in NEURON

   *Parameters*
   - \wGLGDS , \wLSRDS , \wHSRDS (nS)
   - \tau_{GABA1}, \tau_{GABA2}  (ms)
   - g_{leak} (\mu{}Scm^{-2}) 

   - \nGLGDS = 25 , let weight control inhibition                                                                                                                                                  \\
   - \dGLGDS = 0.5 ms, Combination of conductance and synaptic delay

** D Stellate Cell Model:  Optimisation Procedure

   *Fitting Data*: 
   - Click recovery data from \citep{BackoffPalombiEtAl:1997}
   *Optimisation*:
   - Mask/Recovery clicks with recovery periods (2,3,4,8,16 ms)  
   - Measure DS cell recovery response for 2ms 
   - Calc mean squared error normalised to masking response
   - Heuristics: Weighting required to ensure short periods recovered

   *Error*  
   - 0.006671    unweighted (MSE of recovery spike rate / mask rate)
   - 0.01447    final result (MSE of recovery spike rate / mask rate)

   - Narrow response area, non-monotonic RL
   - poor response to noise and clicks
   - asymmetric response to notch noise \citep{ReissYoung:2005}

** Tuberculoventral Cell Model:  Key design factors

   - Rat model (no TS-TV) but has been shown in other mammals
   - Unable to include other DCN inputs
   - Model must show \DSTV inhibition and offset of distribution 
     - Notch noise stimulus \rightarrow need more TV cells across frequency

## Some Hints

For technical presentations, motivation is key 
 Why did you, as
 speaker, take the bus across town or the train halfway across Europe
# or a transatlantic flight just to come and talk about this stuff?  
# Why did the audience turn up at your session? Presumably something in the
# title or abstract caught their eye. (Perhaps they're only here to
# listen to the talk AFTER yours!).  Just getting up from your desk to
# come to the presentation shows some level of motivation from you AND
# the audience. Honour that motivation.  Why is what you're presenting
# important?  
# Why should they (the audience) be interested?  What is it
# about your findings that might be applicable to somebody else and move
# forward their understanding of this area? HINT - it's not page after
# page of detailed methods!!

# Conclusions Applicability / Applications.
# Discussion, assumptions, caveats, applicability to other cases

# Peer Review:

# SPEAKER WANTS technical review, input, ideas, validation of
# work. AUDIENCE WANTS to know how ideas might be applicable to their
# situation.  Presenter likely to have worked on this topic for
# considerable time. Understands the data, context etc. Audience don't
# have this information SO need to spend reasonable amount of time
# explaining context, assumptions, specifics of this
# situation. (Fantastic post by Zen Faulkes on this topic).  Ensure that
# your presentation meets the needs of BOTH you and the audience
# i.e. Don't just show how clever you are - aim to get to the point
# where the audience understands and can give you what YOU want out of
# the meeting (ideas, feedback, new direction). HELP the audience to see
# how what you're presenting could be applicable for them (application
# in new areas, lessons learned etc).  If you over-egg technical stuff
# then audience split into 2 camps: Engaged but lost / Disengaged and
# thinking of other stuff. Type 1 turns into Type 2 quite quickly if you
# don't work hard to get them back. Stop & check understanding from time
# to time. Summarise. Paraphrase. Recap. Don't just ask "Any
# questions?".  For peer review of ALL technical details - write a
# manuscript. DON'T present.
