Chapter 3 of my thesis - Sequential optimisation of network parameters using simple responses

This can be compiled on its own using =latex-makefile=. Typing /make/ will create all the figures 
and export org-mode to latex, then compile the PDF.

The default output is Chapter03.pdf.

This chapter requires Gnuplot, Octave/Matlab, emacs >23, org-mode>6.0, dia, inkscape, xz, and makeglossaries.  

Many figures are cutouts from older academic articles. If you wish to use these, you responsible for obtaining permission

This contains some examples of org-mode's brilliance at reproducible research.

Gnuplot and octave source blocks were used to generate the appropriate script for the Makefile to then create the figure.
